[{"content":"Abstract Introduced (non-native) species that become established may eventually become invasive, so tracking all introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally. The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) (ver. 2.0, November 2022, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9KFFTOD), as of 2022-10-23, is comprised of three lists, for the localities of Alaska (AK, with 545 records), Hawaii (HI, with 5,628 records), and the conterminous (or lower 48) United States (L48, with 8,527 records). Each includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality. To be included in the US-RIIS, a taxon must be non-native everywhere in the locality and established (reproducing) anywhere in the locality. Native pest species are not included. Each record has information on taxonomy, a vernacular name, establishment means (introduced unintentionally, or assisted colonization), degree of establishment (established, invasive, or widespread invasive), hybrid status, pathway of introduction (where available), habitat (where available), dates of introduction (where available), associated taxa (where applicable), native and introduced distributions (where available), and citations for the authoritative source(s) from which this information is drawn. All versions of the US-RIIS builds on a previous dataset, A Comprehensive List of Non-Native Species Established in Three Major Regions of the U.S. (ver. 3.0) (Simpson et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/p9e5k160). In summary, ver. 2.0 of the US-RIIS has 14,700 records in the master list and 12,571 unique names. The list is derived from more than 5,800 authoritative sources, was reviewed by or based on input from more than 30 taxonomic experts and invasive species scientists.

The well is located along the western boundary of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) just south of highway 20. USGS 145 was continuously cored from approximately 3 to 1,368 feet below land surface (BLS), and had water level of 704.73 ft BLS directly after drilling. Core was recovered over a two-year period, this includes cored depths from 3 to 678 ft between May 30, 2017,and November 13, 2017, and from 678 to 1,368 ft between May 17, 2018 and July 12, 2018. After coring was completed, the USGS collected geophysical data and finished construction as a dual piezometer well. The general purpose for the drilling and construction of USGS 145 was to improve the understanding of hydrogeology in the west-central part of the INL and to collect geologic data from recovered core. The well is equipped with a 1-in. stainless steel piezometer line and a 0.75-in. stainless steel piezometer line set down to 1,304 and 1,037 ft BLS, respectively. The well was filled with silica sand and cement grout from 740 to 1,368 ft BLS, encasing the piezometer screened intervals of 1,017 to 1,037 ft BLS and 1,277 to 1,297 ft BLS. The USGS collected select geophysical data, daily drilling notes, and detailed core descriptions to 1,368 ft BLS, which are included as part of this data release. The USGS collected geophysical source and deviation logs through drill casing on July 16, 2018 and additional open borehole logs on July 24, 2018. Geophysical data were collected using Century? multi-parameter logging probes. Geophysical data include natural gamma (tool 9057A), neutron, gamma-gamma density (tool 0024C), and acoustic televiewer (ATV) logs (tool 9804A) which were examined synergistically with available core material to identify contacts between basalt flows and location and thickness of sediment layers. These logs are displayed in the file USGS145_Geophysical_Logs.pdf. Additionally, a gyroscopic deviation survey (tool 9095C) was set to collect data at 0.2-ft increments and used to display the projected well bore path and as displayed in plan view in file USGS145_PlanView_Gyro.pdf and associated well path file USGS145_9095Gyro.asc. Geophysical log data can be obtained by downloading attached LAS files or by visiting USGS - GeoLog Locator. Borehole core from USGS 145 is archived at the USGS Lithologic Core Storage Library located at Central Facilities Area, INL. Drill core was photographed and described using the standardized methods of Johnson and others, 2005. These standardized methods make use of commercially available software that include using a procedure developed by the USGS INL Project Office. The standardized method maximizes description and minimizes interpretation of the borehole core.\nAccess Points https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/64d15b1dd34ef477cf3c0228\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5066/p9qsjv1l/","summary":"Abstract During 2017 and 2018, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory Project Office, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), drilled and constructed borehole USGS 145 (USGS site 433358113042701) for hydrogeologic data collection and stratigraphic framework analyses.

The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation?s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation?s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2019. The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91percent accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping.

Following decades of unsuccessful attempts to develop usable near-surface water sources, the National Park Service constructed a 3,100-foot deep well into the Gallup Sandstone aquifer in 1972, providing the park with the first reliable drinking water source since it was established in 1907. The ~100-foot thick Gallup Sandstone is sandwiched between thick confining sequences of the lower-permeability Mancos Shale. Both the Mancos Shale and the Gallup Sandstone are part of the San Juan Basin and critically, both units have long been targeted for oil and natural gas development. Groundwater-flow (MODFLOW-2005) and advective transport (MODPATH) models of the Mancos Shale and Gallup Sandstone units in the vicinity of CCNHP were created in order to determine groundwater-flow paths to the park well, and to test how potential hydraulic fracturing operations could influence the well.

The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) is comprised of three lists, one each for Alaska (AK, with 532 records), Hawaii (HI, with 6,075 records), and the conterminous United States (L48, with 8,657 records). Each list includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality. To be included in the US-RIIS, a taxon must be non-native everywhere in the locality and established (reproducing) anywhere in the locality. Native pest species are not included. Each record has information on taxonomy, dates of introduction (where available; currently for 38%), invasion status (invasive or introduced), and citations for the authoritative sources from which this information is drawn. The US-RIIS builds on a previous dataset, A Comprehensive List of Non-Native Species Established in Three Major Regions of the U.S.: Version 3.0 (Simpson et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/p9e5k160). There are 15,264 records in the master list and 12,981 unique scientific names. The list is derived from 5,951 authoritative sources, was reviewed by or based on input from 30 invasive species scientists, and continues to be updated. Publication of version 2.0 of the US-RIIS is anticipated (but not guaranteed) in approximately 12 months.

The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) is comprised of three lists, one each for Alaska (AK, with 532 records), Hawaii (HI, with 6,075 records), and the conterminous United States (L48, with 8,657 records). Each list includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality.","title":"United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS)"},{"content":"Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) have collaborated on the development of a notably enhanced global elevation model named the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) that replaces GTOPO30 as the elevation dataset of choice for global and continental scale applications. GMTED2010 provides a new level of detail in global topographic data. The GMTED2010 product suite contains seven new raster elevation products for each of the 30-, 15-, and 7.5-arc-second spatial resolutions and incorporates the current best available global elevation data. The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis. Metadata have also been produced to identify the source and attributes of all the input elevation data used to derive the output products. This new product suite provides global coverage of all land areas from latitude 84 degrees N to 56 degrees S for most products, and coverage from 84 degrees N to 90 degrees S for several products. Some areas, namely Greenland and Antarctica, do not have data available at 15- and 7.5- arc-second resolution. The 30-arc-second layer will only include the mean elevation and systematic subsample. Many of these products will be suitable for various regional continental-scale land cover mapping, extraction of drainage features for hydrologic modeling, and geometric and radiometric correction of medium and coarse resolution satellite image data. The global aggregated vertical accuracy of GMTED2010 can be summarized in terms of the resolution and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the products with respect to a global set of control points (estimated global accuracy of 6 m RMSE) provided by NGA. At 30 arc-seconds, the GMTED2010 RMSE range is between 25 and 42 meters; at 15 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 29 and 32 meters; and at 7.5 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 26 and 30 meters. GMTED2010 is a major improvement in consistency and vertical accuracy over GTOPO30, which has a 66 m RMSE globally compared to the same NGA control points. In areas where new sources of higher resolution data were available, the GMTED2010 products are substantially better than the aggregated global statistics; however, large areas still exist, particularly above 60 degrees North latitude that lack good elevation data. As new data become available, especially in areas that have poor coverage in the current model, it is hoped that new versions of GMTED2010 might be generated and thus gradually improve the global model.\nAccess Points https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-global-multi-resolution-terrain-elevation\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5066/f7j38r2n/","summary":"Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) have collaborated on the development of a notably enhanced global elevation model named the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) that replaces GTOPO30 as the elevation dataset of choice for global and continental scale applications.

The regional groundwater-flow model was initially developed for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Regional Aquifer System Analysis (RASA) program. Periodic revision of the model is required as the result of changing hydrologic stresses, different and more complex water management needs, and increased knowledge of hydrologic conditions. The RASA model was initially constructed in the 1980?s as a quasi-3D model with 10 aquifers. The 9 intervening confining units were simulated using vertical leakage parameters at the aquifer contacts. The model was revised in the late 1990?s by (1) rediscretizing the model parameters with smaller grid spacing, (2) rediscretizing the stream cells for a better representation of streams, (3) using a spatially variable recharge rate based on studies conducted by the New Jersey Water Science Center since the model was initially developed, and (4) updating groundwater withdrawal data to 1998. For this study, the USGS, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, again revised the model, updating the hydrogeologic framework, hydraulic parameters, and groundwater withdrawals. The revised 21-layer, fully three-dimensional, NJCP groundwater-flow model extends into Delaware and parts of Maryland and simulates 11 aquifers and 10 intervening confining units. The revisions include spatially and temporally variable recharge estimated using a Soil-Water-Balance (version 1.0.1) model; updated hydrologic parameters using UCODE_2014 (version 1.004) including the confining units in New Jersey and the hydrogeologic units in Maryland and Delaware; updated boundary flows from the North Atlantic Coastal Plain groundwater-flow model; groundwater withdrawals from 1980-2013 for the New Jersey Coastal Plain and from 1980-2010 for the modeled areas in Delaware and Maryland; and additional model layers to refine the simulated flow in Atlantic and Cape May Counties, New Jersey. The revisions to the model allows for (1) refined boundary flows for local models, (2) improved simulated interaction between water levels in southern New Jersey and withdrawals in Delaware, (3) simulation of the unconfined Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system and confined Rio Grande water-bearing zone, and (4) the ability to do particle tracking to determine regional sources of flow and times of travel. The groundwater flow model provides water managers with a tool to better understand the groundwater system of the New Jersey Coastal Plain, evaluate groundwater budget components, and make informed water-resource management decisions. This USGS data release contains all the input and output files for the simulations described in the associated model documentation report (https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20235066).\nAccess Points https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/640105ebd34edc0ffaf4f0ac\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5066/p9w6rxfc/","summary":"Abstract A third revision of the New Jersey Coastal Plain (NJCP) groundwater flow model, using MODFLOW-2005 (version 1.12.00), was completed to maintain the model?s usefulness for water-resource managment and development.

These pixels were selected from a sample frame of all pixels in the ARD grid system which fell within the map area (Dwyer et al., 2018). Interpretation used the TimeSync reference data collection tool which visualizes Landsat images and Landsat data values for all usable images in the time series (1984?2021) (Cohen et al., 2010). Interpreters also referred to air photos and high resolution images available in Google Earth as well as several ancillary data layers. The interpreted land cover attributes were crosswalked to the LCMAP annual land cover classes: Developed, Cropland, Grass/Shrub, Tree Cover, Wetland, Water, Snow/Ice and Barren. Validation analysis directly compared reference labels with annual LCMAP land cover map attributes by cross tabulation. The results of that assessment are reported here as confusion matrices for land cover agreement and land cover change agreement. Accuracy and standard errors have been calculated using stratified estimation (Stehman, 2014). Land cover class proportions were also estimated from the reference data for each year, 1985?2021.

The tanks were filled with native water during the first day of each study period. Four different treatment methods were represented within each cradle. For all three study periods, three of the four treatments remained constant: ammonium hydroxide, sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate, and untreated. For the 1-week study period in February, the fourth treatment method was sodium nitrate. For the 2-week study periods in May and July, urea replaced sodium nitrate for analysis. Treatments were added to the tanks following the profiles on the first day of each study period. Nutrient samples were collected and processed by Nova Southeastern University.

The Utica and Marcellus Shale Plays in the Appalachian Basin are the 4th and 1st largest natural gas producing plays in the United States. Hydrocarbon production generates large volumes of brine (\u0026ldquo;produced water\u0026rdquo;) that must be disposed of, treated, or reused. Though Marcellus brines have been studied extensively, there are few studies from the Utica Shale Play. This study presents new brine chemical analyses from 16 Utica Shale Play wells in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Results from Na-Cl-Br systematics and stable and radiogenic isotopes suggest that the Utica Shale Play brines are likely residual pore water concentrated beyond halite saturation during the formation of the Ordovician Beekmantown evaporative sequence. The narrow range of chemistry for the Utica Shale Play produced waters (e.g., total dissolved solides = 214 - 283 g/L) over both time and space implies a consistent composition for disposal and reuse planning. The amount of salt produced annually from the Utica Shale Play is equivalent to 3.4% of annual U.S. halite production. Utica Shale Play brines have radium activities 580 times the EPA maximum contaminant level and are supersaturated with respect to barite, indicating the potential for surface and aqueous radium hazards if not properly disposed of.\nAccess Points https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5eba8f8082ce25b51360cb5f\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5066/p9an5gj0/","summary":"Abstract Citation Note: These data were collected as part of a research study published in Environmental Science and Technology.
