[{"content":"Abstract Advances in spring migratory phenology comprise some of the most well-documented evidence for the impacts of climate change on birds. Nevertheless, surprisingly little research has investigated whether birds are shifting their migratory phenology equally across sex and age classes – a question critical to understanding the potential for trophic mismatch. We used 60-years of bird banding data across North America – comprising over 4 million captures in total – to investigate both spring and fall migratory phenology for a total of 98 bird species across sex and age classes, with the exact numbers of species for each analysis depending on season-specific data availability. Consistent with protandry, in spring (n=89 species), adult males were the first to arrive and immature females were the last to arrive. In fall (n=98), there was little difference between sexes, but adults tended to depart earlier than juveniles. Over 60 years, adult males advanced their phenology the fastest (-0.84 days per decade, 95CrI = -1.22 to -0.47, n=36), while adult and immature females advanced at a slower pace, causing the gap in male and female arrival times to widen over time. In the fall, there was no overall trend in phenology by age or sex (n=57), driven in part by high interspecific variation related to breeding and molt strategies. Our results indicate consistent and predictable age- and sex-based differences in the rates at which species’ springtime phenology is shifting. The growing gap between male and female migratory arrival indicates sex-based plasticity in adaptation to climate change that has strong potential to negatively impact current and future population trends.\nMethods See Methods of Neate-Clegg \u0026amp; Tingley, Global Change Biology. Briefly, raw banding data were extracted from the USGS Bird Banding Lab. A series of stringent filters were applied to narrow the dataset down to meet sample size requirements. Then, Weibull-corrected phenological metrics were calculated for every age group and sex for every species.\nAccess Points https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.m905qfv4v\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5061/dryad.m905qfv4v/","summary":"Abstract Advances in spring migratory phenology comprise some of the most well-documented evidence for the impacts of climate change on birds.

Dendrobatid poison frogs bioaccumulate alkaloids from their diet to make themselves toxic or unpalatable to predators. Despite the proposed roles of plasma proteins as mediators of alkaloid trafficking and bioavailability, the responsible proteins have not been identified. We use chemical approaches to show that a ~50 kDa plasma protein is the principal alkaloid binding molecule in blood from poison frogs. Proteomic and biochemical studies establish this plasma protein to be liver-derived alkaloid-binding globulin (ABG) that is a member of the serine-protease inhibitor (serpin) family. In addition to alkaloid binding activity, ABG sequesters and regulates the bioavailability of “free” plasma alkaloids in vitro. Unexpectedly, ABG is not related to saxiphilin or albumin but instead exhibits sequence and structural homology to mammalian hormone carriers and amphibian biliverdin binding proteins. Alkaloid-binding globulin (ABG) represents a new small molecule binding functionality in serpin proteins, a novel mechanism of plasma alkaloid transport in poison frogs, and more broadly points towards serpins acting as tunable scaffolds for small molecule binding and transport across different organisms.\nMethods Animal usage All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stanford (protocol #34153). Topical benzocaine was used for anesthesia prior to the euthanasia of all animals. Laboratory-bred animals were purchased from Understory Enterprises (Ontario, Canada) or Josh’s Frogs (Michigan, USA) depending on the species. Animals were either euthanized for plasma collection upon arrival, or housed in 183 inch glass terraria, and fed a diet of non-toxic Drosophila melanogaster until euthanasia. Plasma and tissues from a total of 62 animals were used for this study, consisting of 32 lab-bred animals and 30 field-collected animals that are described below. Plasma collections Lab-bred, and therefore non-toxic, poison frogs were anesthetized with topical application of 10% benzocaine on the ventral skin, and euthanized with cervical translocation. Blood was collected directly from the cervical cut using a heparinized capillary tube (22-362-566, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and deposited into a lithium-heparin-coated microvette tube (20.1282.100, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Blood was spun down for 10 minutes at 5000 rpm at 4°C on a benchtop centrifuge, and the top layer which contains the plasma was removed and pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube. This was stored at -80°C until it was used for experiments. UV crosslinking and competition using alkaloid-like photoprobe Photocrosslinking methods follow methods outlined in Kim et al., 2020 [1]. Plasma or purified protein was thawed on ice. The total reaction volume was 50 uL and all experiments were performed in a clear 96-well plate. For plasma, 5 μL of undiluted plasma was mixed with 40 μL of PBS for each reaction. For purified O. sylvatica protein, 10 μg of protein was diluted into PBS per reaction to a volume of 45 μL. For E. tricolor and D. tinctorius protein, 60 μg and 35 μg were used, respectively; a higher amount of protein was used because no photocrosslinking was detected at 10 μg for these proteins. To this, either 2.5 μL of DMSO was added as vehicle control, or 2.5 μL of competitor compound dissolved in DMSO was added at a final concentration of 100 μM for plasma competition experiments unless indicated otherwise, or 1 mM for purified protein experiments unless indicated otherwise. The competitor compounds were: custom synthesized pumiliotoxin 251D (PTX, PepTech, Burlington, MA), decahydroquinoline (DHQ, 125741, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), epibatidine (epi, E1145, Sigma-Aldrich), a histrionicotoxin-like compound (HTX, ENAH2C55884A-50MG, Sigma-Aldrich), indolizidine (indol, ATE24584802-100MG, Sigma-Aldrich), nicotine (nic, N3876-100ML, Sigma-Aldrich), cortisol (cort, H0888-1G, Sigma-Aldrich). The “toxin mixture” (TM) used as a competitor in Figure 6 was made by taking 20μL of each of the skin alkaloid extracts from wild frogs described below, evaporating it under gentle nitrogen gas flow, and resuspending in 100μL of DMSO. This was followed by addition of 2.5 μL of photoprobe (Z2866906198, Enamine, Kyiv, Ukraine) dissolved in DMSO on ice, for a final photoprobe concentration of 5 μM in plasma experiments and 100 μM in purified protein experiments. This was incubated on ice for 10 minutes, and then UV crosslinked (Stratalinker UV 1800 Crosslinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 5 minutes on ice. TAMRA visualization of crosslinked proteins was done by adding 3 μl TBTA (stock solution: 1.7 mM in 4:1 v/v DMSO:tert-Butanol; H66485-03, Fisher), 1 μl Copper (II) Sulfate (stock solution: 50 mM in water; BP346-500, Fisher), 1 μl Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (freshly prepared, stock solution: 50 mM; J60316-06, Fisher), and 1 μl TAMRA-N3 (stock solution: 1.25 mM in DMSO; T10182, Fisher), incubating at room temperature for 1 hour, and quenching the reaction by boiling with 4x SDS loading buffer. This was run on a Nupage 4-12% Bis-Tris protein gel (NP0323BOX, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and the in-gel fluorescence of the gel was visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska) at 600 nm for an exposure time of 30 seconds. After imaging the TAMRA signal, the same gel was coomassie stained (InstantBlue, ISB1L, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and visualized the same way at 700 nm. For proteomic identification of competed proteins, plasma samples were pooled from five different individuals and were crosslinked with either no photoprobe and equivalent amounts of DMSO, 5 μM photoprobe and DMSO, or 5 μM photoprobe and 100 μM PTX as described above. Each condition was set up as 24 individual reactions and pooled after crosslinking. To attach a biotin handle, 3 μl TBTA, 1 ul CuSO4, 1 μl TCEP, and 1.14 μl Biotin-N3 (stock solution: 9.67 mM in DMSO; 1265, Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ), were added for each reaction and this was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, rotating. After incubation, each condition was run through a 3kDa MWCO centrifuge filter twice (UFC800324, Amicon, Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) to dilute excess Biotin-N3 until reaching a 900x dilution. Pulldown of biotinylated photoprobe-protein complexes was achieved with a magnetic bead strep pulldown following the protocol outlined in Wei et al., 2021[2]. The pre and post-pulldown samples were run on a gel for a streptavidin blot (Figure 2A) and silver stain. After verifying pulldown efficacy, samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels in two replicates (one lane each) for each condition. Gels were fixed in 50:50 water:MeOH with 10% Acetic Acid for 1-2 hours. For the first replicate, the gel was run for a short period, and an approximately one-centimeter squared portion containing the whole lane for each condition was excised and fixed. For the second replicate, the gel was run completely and the proteins between 39 kDa and 64 kDa were excised and fixed using the ladder as a size reference. Sections were chopped into 1 mm pieces under sterile conditions and stored at 4°C in 100μL of water with 1% acetic acid until processed for proteomics. Proteomic identification of pulled down proteins across conditions For proteomics analyses, SDS-PAGE gel slices approximately 1 cm in length were prepared for proteolytic digestion. Each fixed gel slice was diced into 1 mm cubes under sterile conditions, and then rinsed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to remove residual acidification from the fixing process. Following rinsing, the gels were incubated in 80% acetonitrile in water for five minutes; the solvent was removed and then the gel pieces were incubated with 10 mM DTT dissolved in water at room temperature for 20 minutes. Following reduction, alkylation was performed using 30 mM acrylamide for 30 minutes at room temperature to cap free reduced cysteines. Proteolysis was performed using trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37°C. Resulting samples were spun to pellet gel fragments prior to extraction of the peptides present in the supernatant. The resulting peptides were dried by speed vac before dissolution in a reconstitution buffer (2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid), with an estimated 1 μg on-column used for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry experiment was performed using an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer RRID:022212 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) with liquid chromatography using an Acquity M-Class UPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). A flow rate of 300 nL/min was used, where mobile phase A was 0.2% formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. Analytical columns were prepared in-house with an I.D. of 100 microns pulled to a nanospray emitter using a P2000 laser puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The column was packed using C18 reprosil Pur 1.8 micron stationary phase (Dr. Maisch) to an approximate length of 25 cm. Peptides were directly injected onto the analytical column using a 80-minute gradient (2%–45% B, followed by a high-B wash). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent fashion using CID fragmentation in the ion trap for MS/MS spectra generation. For data analysis, the .RAW data files were processed using Byonic v4.1.5 (Protein Metrics, Cupertino, CA) to identify peptides and infer proteins based on a proteomic reference created with the O. sylvatica genome annotation. Proteolysis with Trypsin/LysC was assumed to be specific with up to 2 missed proteolytic cleavages. Precursor mass accuracies were held within 12 ppm, and 0.4 Da for MS/MS fragments in the ion trap. Cysteine modified with propionamide were set as fixed modifications in the search, and other common modifications (e.g. oxidation of methionine) were also included. Proteins were held to a false discovery rate of 1%, using standard reverse-decoy technique [3]. Identification of ABG proteins in different species and sequence confirmation To identify potential ABG proteins in other species, we used the OsABG protein sequence identified in the proteomics as the query and searched against blast databases created from the Allobates femoralis genome, and Epipedobates tricolor, Dendrobates tinctorius, and Mantella aurantiaca transcriptomes. The top hit from each blast search was used as the most probable ABG gene from those species. To ensure that the sequences did not contain sequencing or alignment errors, the gene from O. sylvatica, D. tinctorius, and E. tricolor was amplified using PCR and sequence confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from flash-frozen liver tissue from three lab-bred, non-toxic, individuals from each species using the Monarch total RNA Miniprep Kit (T2010S, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) following manufacturer instructions. This was used to create cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (18080-400, Invitrogen), following manufacturer instructions with an oligo(dT)20 primer. This was used for a PCR using Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase (F-530, Thermo Scientific) and the primers and cycling conditions described below. PCRs were analyzed using a 1% agarose gel for presence of a single band, cleaned up (NucleoSpin Gel and PCR cleanup, 740609.50, Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), and transformed into pENTR vectors using a D-TOPO kit (45-0218, Invitrogen). Plasmids containing the ABG sequences from each individual were then mini-prepped (27106X4, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Sanger sequenced with M13F and M13R primers (Azenta Life Sciences, South San Francisco, California). Sequences were aligned using Benchling (Benchling Inc, San Francisco, California) software, with MAFFT used for DNA alignments and Clustal Omega used for protein alignments. species fwd primer rev primer Tm O. sylvatica CACCATGAAACTTTTCGTCTACCTGTGTTTCAGC CTATTTTGTTGGGTCTACTATTCTTCCGCTG 68°C D. tinctorius CACCATGAAGCTTTTCGTCTTCCTATGTTTCAGCC CTATTTTGTTGGGTTTATTATTTTTCCATTCAAAATATCG 66°C E. tricolor CACCATGAAGCTTTTCATCTTCCTGTGTTTGAGCC CTATTTTGTTGGGTCTATTATTCTTCCGGAGAAAAC 68°C Cycling conditions: 98°C for 30 seconds, [98°C for 10 seconds, Tm for 30 seconds, 72°C for 2 minutes] x 34 cycles, 72°C for 10 minutes Protein structure prediction and molecular docking analyses The OsABG protein folding was predicted using the amino acid sequence, edited for point mutations found across all three individuals used for sequence verification, and the AlphaFold Google Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb)[4]. The predicted structure is provided in the supplementary information. The default AlphaFold parameters were used. Molecular docking was performed using the UCSF Chimera software (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)[5], using AutoDock Vina [6,7] with the three-dimensional structure of PTX 251D (Pubchem CID 6440480). The whole protein was used as the search space with the default search parameters (5 binding modes, exhaustiveness of search of 8, and a maximum energy difference of 3 kcal/mol). The docking result with the highest predicted affinity was used and is included in the supplementary files. Protein structures and docking were visualized using PyMol for publication-quality images. Recombinant protein expression and binding assays Recombinant ABG proteins were expressed by Kemp Proteins (Maryland, USA) through their custom insect cell protein expression and purification services. The reagents and vectors used are proprietary to Kemp Proteins, however, the general expression and purification details are as follows. The verified protein sequences described above or the point mutations (Figure 4) were codon-optimized for SF9 insect expression, and a 10xHIS tag was added to the C-terminal end. For OsABG, a 1 L expression was performed, for all other sequences (other species and mutants) a 50 mL expression was used. For the 1 L expression, a multiplicity of infection of one was used for the p1 baculovirus, and the supernatant was collected after 72 hours. To this, 5 mL of Qiagen Ni-NTA resin washed and equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH=7.8) was added and it was mixed overnight at 4°C. Afterwards, it was packed in a 5 mL Bio-Scale column and washed with 3 column volumes (CV) of Buffer A, followed by washing with 5% Buffer B (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole, pH=7.8) for 5 CV. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 5-60% over 25 CV, and 6 mL fractions were collected throughout. All of the fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated to 1 mg/mL using an Amicon centrifugal filter with a 10 kDa MWCO, the buffer was exchanged to PBS, it was filtered through a 0.2 um filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C. Protein expression and purification resulted in a clear band by western blot (Figure S4A) and a clean doublet pattern by coomassie (Figure S4B) closely resembling that seen in the plasma crosslinking results (Figure 1C) in both reduced and non-reduced conditions. For the 50mL expression of DtABG, EtABG, and mutant OsABG proteins, a 10% ratio of p1 virus to media was used and the supernatant was collected after 72 hours, to which 1 mL of Qiagen Ni-NTA resin washed and equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH=7.4) was added. This was mixed overnight at 4°C and then packed into a 1 mL Bio-Scale column, washed with 3 CV of Buffer A, washed with 5 CV of 5% Buffer B (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH=7.4), and eluted with 5 CV of 50% Buffer B. Fractions containing protein were buffer exchanged into PBS, and the final concentrations were approximately 0.2 mg/mL, with varying final volumes. Protein expression and purification resulted in a clear band by western blot (Figure S4C,E,G,I,K), and a clean doublet by coomassie (Figure S4D,F,H,J,L) in both reduced and non-reduced conditions. Determination of dissociation constant using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) To determine the binding affinity of OsABG for PTX, we used Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) to determine the dissociation constant (KD). To do this, we used the Monolith system (Nanotemper Technologies, München, Germany). Purified OsABG protein was labeled using the protein labeling kit Red-NHS 2nd generation (MO-L011, Nanotemper) which dyes primary lysine residues in the protein. The kit was used following manufacturer instructions, however, a 1.5x excess of dye was used instead of 3x as this was found to better achieve a degree of labeling of ~0.5. To remove aggregates during the assay, PBS-Tween was used for protein labeling and all dilutions. The labeled protein was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 20,000g on a benchtop centrifuge, and the supernatant was taken to further remove any aggregation. The concentration was measured prior to calculating and setting up dilution series. A final concentration of 10nM OsABG was used, and a 16-tube 2x serial dilution series of PTX 251D was made with the highest concentration being 1000uM. The concentration of DMSO was maintained consistent across the dilution series. The labeled OsABG was incubated for 10 minutes prior to loading into capillaries, and three biological replicates were pipetted and run separately. The Monolith premium capillaries (MO-K025, Nanotemper) were used, the MST power was set to Medium, and the excitation power was set to auto-detect. The three replicates were compiled and plotted together using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California), and a dissociation model was fit to the data to calculate the KD. The raw data is included in the supplementary information (will be included with full submission). Determination of free versus bound alkaloids Solutions with 4 uM of OsABG protein, 4 uM of either PTX 251D or nicotine, and a final volume of 100 uL were made and incubated for one hour at room temperature. This was transferred to a 3 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (UFC500396, Amicon) and spun at max speed on a benchtop centrifuge at 4C for 45 minutes. The top and bottom fractions were brought up to 100 uL with ultrapure water and transferred to new tubes, where 300 uL of 2:1 Acetonitrile:Methanol was added, after which they were vortexed and centrifuged at max speed on a benchtop centrifuge at 4C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials for quantitation of the amount of alkaloid in each fraction with mass spectrometry. Each condition was run in triplicate. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent Quadrupole time-of-flight LC-MS instrument, with MS analysis performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. Metabolites were separated with an Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent 959961-902) with normal phase chromatography. Mobile phases were: buffer A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 10% water with 0.1% formic acid). The flow rate was maintained constant at 0.7 mL/min throughout the LC protocol. The LC gradient elution was set as follows: starting at 5% B held till 0.51 minutes, linear gradient from 5 to 25% B in 1.5 minutes, linear gradient from 25 to 50% B in 23 minutes, linear gradient from 50 to 95% B in 30 seconds, 95% B held for 2 minutes, linear gradient from 95 to 5% B in 1 minute, and 5% B held for 1.5 minutes to equilibrate the column to the initial conditions. The total run time was 30 minutes and the injection volume was 10 uL. Data was analyzed using the Agilent MassHunter software; the extracted ion chromatograms for PTX were searched using the exact mass M+1 of 252.2333, and nicotine was searched using the exact mass M+1 of 163.123, with a tolerance of a symmetric +/- 100 ppm. Extracted ion chromatograms were smoothed once before automatically integrating to get the abundance values. Abundance values were used to calculate the fractions above and below the filter for each replicate, which were then plotted with GraphPad. All raw data is provided as mzXML files here. Field Collections of Oophaga sylvatica The frog samples used in this paper are the same as those used for the project described in Moskowitz et al., 2022 [8]. For each location, 10 O. sylvatica individuals were collected under collection permit 0013-18 IC-FAU-DNB/MA issued by the Ministerio del Ambiente de Ecuador, between the hours of 7:00–18:00 during early May to early June 2019. All individuals were euthanized the same day as collection. Prior to euthanizing, frogs were sexed, weighed, and the snout-vent length was measured. Orajel (10% benzocaine) was used as an anesthetic prior to cervical dislocation. Once euthanized, frogs were immediately dissected and the liver, intestines, and half of the dorsal skin were stored in RNAlater in cryotubes at room temperature. The other half of the dorsal skin was placed in methanol in glass tubes at room temperature. Once back in the lab, all tissues were stored at -20°C until further processing. All tissues were transported to the United States under CITES permits 19EC000036/VS, 19EC000037/VS, 19EC000038/VS. Alkaloid extraction, detection, and analysis All the following steps were performed under a hood. Skins were taken out of methanol with forceps and weighed. From the methanol that the skin was stored in, 1 mL was taken and syringe filtered through a 0.45μ PTFE filter (44504-NP, Thermo Scientific) into the new glass vial with a PTFE cap (60940A-2, Fisher) filled with 25 μL of 1 μg/μL (-)-Nicotine (N3876-100ML, Sigma Aldrich), for a total of 25 μg of added nicotine. Tubes were capped and vortexed, and stored at -80°C for 24 hours, during which proteins and lipids should precipitate. After 24 hours, tubes were taken out of the -80°C and quickly syringe filtered through a 0.45μ PTFE filter again into a new glass vial. A 100 μL aliquot was added to a GC-MS autosampler vial, and remaining solution was stored in the original capped vial at -80°C. GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 instrument with a Shimadzu 30m x 0.25 mmID SH-Rxi-5Sil MS column closely following the protocol outlined in Saporito et al., 2010 [9]. In brief, GC separation of alkaloids was achieved using a temperature program from 100 to 280°C at a rate of 10°C per minute with He as the carrier gas (flow rate: 1 mL/min). This was followed by a 2-minute hold and additional ramp to 320°C at a rate of 10°C/minute for column protection reasons, and no alkaloids appeared during this part of the method. Compounds were analyzed with electron impact-mass spectrometry (EI-MS). The GC-MS data files were exported as CDF files and the Global Natural Products Social Network (GNPS) was used to perform the deconvolution and library searching against the AMDIS (NIST) database to identify all compounds (https://gnps.ucsd.edu) [10]. For deconvolution (identification of peaks and abundance estimates) the default parameters were used, for the library search the precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 20000 Da and the MS/MS fragment ion tolerance to 0.5 Da. The resulting dataset was filtered to keep only compounds that matched to our spiked-in nicotine standard, alkaloids previously found in poison frogs from the Daly 2005 database [11], or compounds with the same base ring structure and R groups as the classes defined in Daly 2005. All GC-MS data as CDF files are available through the GNPS public data repository (accessing information will be added for full submission). Once the feature table from the GNPS deconvolution was filtered to only include only poison frog alkaloids and nicotine, the abundance values were normalized by dividing by the nicotine standard and skin weight. This filtered and normalized feature table was used for all further analyses and visualizations. All steps were carried out with R version 4.0.4, and code is included in supplementary data. RNA extraction and library preparation RNA extraction followed the Trizol (15596018, Thermo Fisher) RNA isolation protocol outlined in Caty et al. 2019 [12] according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and with sample randomization to avoid batch effects. RNA quality was measured on a Agilent Tapestation RNA screentape (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and quantified using a Qubit Broad Range RNA kit (Q10210, Invitrogen). In the liver and intestines, samples with RIN scores greater than 5 were kept, RNA was normalized to the same Qubit concentration, and mRNA was isolated and library prepped using the NEB Directional RNA sequencing kit (E7765L, New England Biolabs) with the PolyA purification bundle (E7490L, New England Biolabs) and 96 Unique Dual Indices (E7765L, New England Biolabs). The skin RIN scores were much lower, signaling potential RNA degradation, ribosomal degradation was instead used to isolate mRNA. Following normalization within all skin RNA samples to the same Qubit concentration, we used the Zymo RiboFree Total RNA Library Prep kit (R3003-B, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) following manufacturer instructions. After library prep for all tissues was complete library size was quantified with the Agilent Tapestation D1000 screentape, and concentration was measured with the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity kit (Q33231, Invitrogen). All libraries within a tissue type were pooled to equimolar amounts and sequenced on two lanes of an Illumina NovaSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) machine to obtain 150 bp paired-end reads. RNA expression analysis and identification of O. sylvatica serpinA genes Analysis of RNA expression levels followed the protocol outlined by Payne et al., 2022 [13]. The Trim-galore! wrapper tool [14] was used to trim adapter sequences with cutadapt [15] and quality filter the reads (trim_galore \u0026ndash;paired \u0026ndash;phred33 \u0026ndash;length 36 -q 30 \u0026ndash;stringency 1 -e 0.001). All trimmed reads are available through the NCBI BioProject (accessing information will be added for full submission). Kallisto [16] was used to pseudoalign the reads to a reference created with the coding sequence of the annotated O. sylvatica genome. These abundances were combined into a matrix, and the trimmed-mean of M-values (TMM) normalized counts were used for all further analyses. Additional serpinA genes were found in the genome by searching for all genes annotated with “serpina” in the header, and by blasting the OsABG protein sequence against the genome (e-value \u0026lt; 1e-60) and including any additional genes not annotated with “serpina.” Four sequences were removed because they were exact matches of the full gene (OopSylGTT00000004683), the N-terminal end (OopSylGTT00000004650, OopSylGTT00000004685), or the C-terminal (OopSylGTT00000004676) end sequence of another serpina gene, and therefore could be potential duplications caused by annotation or assembly errors. To create the protein tree (Figure 6D), ClustalW was used to align the sequences, a distance matrix was created using identity, and neighbor joining was used to construct the tree. The albumin gene was determined by blasting the protein sequences of Xenopus laevis albumin A (Uniprot #P08759), X. laevis albumin B (Uniprot #P14872), and the Asian toad Bombina maxima albumin (Uniprot #Q3T478) against the O. sylvatica genome. In all three cases, the top hit was the same (OopSylGTT00000003067), therefore this was assumed to be the most likely albumin candidate in the genome and was used to plot the TMM expression for comparison. All plots were created in R version 4.0.4, and all analysis and plotting code is available in the supplementary files (will be included with full submission). References 1.

They are named bci.tree1 through bci.tree8 and bci.stem1 through bci.stem8, with the number corresponding to a census. Every tree table includes a record for every tree appearing in the 50-ha plot across all censuses, with one row per tree and one table per census. Trees not yet censused and dead trees are included, allowing the fate of every tree to be tallied in every census. The rows in every tree table are in exactly the same order, so the 8 tree tables are effectively a single giant table, with columns for every one of the 8 censuses. They are divided into separate tables for easier access. Moreover, each individual census table is self-contained, and if a user needs only one census, then only that one census table is necessary. For most purposes the most recent, bci.tree8, should serve for a single census. The 8 stem tables form a parallel set having one row for every stem ever censused. In the tree tables, if stemID matches for a given tree in 2 censuses, then it is certain that the same stem was measured in both censuses. If the stemID differs between censuses, it often means that the first stem broke and a new stem was measured. However, in trees with 2 or more stems, it was not always possible to identify stems with certainty across censuses prior to 2010, because stem tags were not used. This means that there are cases where the stemID changes even though the stem(s) really did persist. The cleanest way to assess growth is to use only those cases where the stemID matches between censuses. It is also necessary to check the HOM (height-of-measurement) in case it changes between censuses. In the stem tables, records on matching rows are guaranteed to be the same stem, but the HOM might change. The 8 tree tables are zipped into the single file bci.tree.zip, and the 8 stem tables into bci.stem.zip. Columns in R Analytical Tables: Tree and Stem treeID: The unique tree identifier in the database. Guarantees a tree match. stemID: The unique stem identifier in the database. Guarantees a stem match. tag: Tag number on the tree (occasionally negative where a tag was duplicated by mistake). StemTag: Tag number on the individual stem, if present. sp: The species mnemonic. See the R Species Table for full Latin names. quadrat: Quadrat designation, as a 2-digit row number then 2-digit column number on a 20x20 m grid. gx: The x coordinate within the plot, meters from the west border of the plot, always in [0,1000). gy: The y coordinate, meters from the south border, always in [0,500). dbh: Diameter (mm) of one stem on the tree, the stem whose stemID is given. hom: The height-of-measure, meters above the ground, where the dbh was measured. ExactDate: The date on which a tree was measured. date: Integer date for easy calculation of time interval between censuses (the number of days since 1 Jan 1960). codes: The codes describing the measurement as recorded in the field. See Condit (1998) for a description of field codes. For analyses, status codes should be used, not field codes. status: A status code for the tree or stem. See the section below, Status Codes for Analyses. DFstatus: Alternate stem status, redundant relative to status. nostems: The number of living stems on the date of measurement. agb: Above-ground-biomass of all stems on the tree, in Mg (= metric tons), or for the individual stem. Note that agb=0 for dead trees. ba: Basal area of all stems on the tree, in square meters. Note that ba=0 for dead trees. Status Codes for Analyses These indicate whether a tree (stem) is alive (A) or dead (D), with some further complications. Status A=alive is assigned to a tree if it has any living stem or sprout. Status D=dead is only used when an entire tree is dead. A third status is P=prior, necessary because each of the analytical tables has a record for every tree (or stem). Thus, there must be records in early censuses for trees that recruited in later censuses, and these trees have status P. In a complete life cycle, a tree begins with status P, becomes A, then D; for many trees, the cycle includes only P to A, or A to D, or just A over all 8 censues. Additional status codes are necessary because a stem can be dead while the tree is still alive, and for rare cases where trees were missed during a census or recorded as dead once then later alive. Status Codes for Analyses (the status column in R Analytical Tables) A: Alive, applied to either the tree or stem. D: Dead, meaning the entire tree is dead, ie with no living stems or sprouts. P: Prior, applied to a tree (or stem) in censuses prior to its appearance in the plot. M: Missing, indicating that the tree was skipped by mistake during the census, so it could have been alive or dead. AD: A seldom-used code, applied when a tree was noted as dead in one census but was found alive in a later census. For most purposes, this code should be interpreted the same as code A for alive. AR: A similar unusual code, applied when a stem was noted as broken in one census but intact in a later census. For most purposes, this code should be interpreted the same as code A for alive. G: Gone, for stems only, meaning the stem broke or otherwise disappeared, but other stems on the tree were alive and measured. V: Vanished, for stems only. This is needed in the BCI plot because stem tags were not used before the 2010 census. It is often the case where a tree had 2 or more stems that were, after 5 years, impossible to match. When this was true, new stems with new stemIDs and thus new rows in the stem table were created. Earlier stems were given status=V. In most cases, V means the stems persisted but could not be tracked. R Species Table A single table in R format with taxonomic details on the species names used in the plot database as well as wood density. This is matched to the R Analytical Tables with the species mnemonic (column sp). The R species table includes many species not found in the 50-ha plot but known in other plots in Panama. More information and references about the plot tree species, including all taxonomic changes since 1982, is available in a separate data archive (Condit et al. 2019). Columns in R Species Table sp: The species mnemonic. Latin: Full Latin name. Genus: Taxonomic genus. Species: Taxonomic species. Family: Following (mostly) the angiosperm classification at http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/. SpeciesID: The unique species identifier in the database. Guarantees a species match. SubspeciesID: The unique subspecies identifier in the database. Guarantees a subspecies match. Authority: Taxonomic authority. IDLevel: The taxonomic level to which the species is identified, usually species, otherwise it is a recognizable morphospecies, not named to species (usually the genus is known). syn: Prior names used in the BCI plot. subsp: Infraspecific name (blank in most cases because no subspecies name is used). wsg: Wood specific gravity (grams per cm3 dry weight). wsglevel: The taxonomic level for which wsg is known, ie where this is genus it means the wsg is the average for the genus (unrelated to IDLevel). Topography of the BCI plot A tab-delimited ascii text table, BCIelev.tsv, with precise topography of the BCI 50-ha plot. See Harms et al. (2001) for details. Columns in Topography of the BCI plot x: The x coordinate within the plot, in meters from the west border. y: The y plot coordinate, in meters from the south border. elev: Elevation above sea-level in meters. Full Measurement Table A tab-delimited text table, FullMeasurementBCI.tsv, zipped as FullMeasurementBCI.zip. The table includes a measurement of every stem at every HOM (height-of-measure) taken in the 50-ha plot over 1982-2015. In this table, every measurement is a separate row, so records for the same tree are on multiple rows. The R Analytical tables include the same measurements in a more convenient format for analysis. However, there are some measurements in this full table not appearing in analytical tables. Those are cases where a tree was measured at several HOMs due to buttresses. In the R tables, only a single measurement per stem is included, designed so that as many censuses as possible are at the same HOM. Analyses of trunk taper require this table instead of R Analytical Tables (Cushman 2014). Columns in Full Measurement Table Family: Same as R Species Table. Genus: Same as R Species Table. SpeciesName: Same as Species in R Species Table. Mnemonic: Same as sp in R Species Table. Subspecies: Same as subsp in R Species Table. SpeciesID: Same as R Species Table.

Although the evolutionary loss of plasticity has been linked both theoretically and empirically to increased rates of phenotypic diversification, molecular insights into how this process might unfold are generally lacking. Here, we show that a regulator of nongenetic inheritance links evolutionary loss of plasticity in nature to changes in plasticity and morphology as selected in the laboratory. Across nematodes of Diplogastridae, which ancestrally had a polyphenism, or discrete plasticity, in their feeding morphology, we use molecular evolutionary analyses to screen for change associated with independent losses of plasticity. Having inferred a set of ancestrally polyphenism-biased genes from phylogenetically informed gene-knockouts and gene-expression comparisons, selection signatures associated with plasticity’s loss identify the histone H3K4 di/monodemethylase gene spr-5/LSD1/KDM1A. Manipulations of this gene affect both sensitivity and variation in plastic morphologies, and artificial selection of manipulated lines drives multigenerational shifts in these phenotypes. Our findings thus give mechanistic insight into how traits are modified as they traverse the continuum of greater to lesser environmental sensitivity.\nMethods These data and R code correspond to-identification of morph-biased genes in Pristionchus fissidentatus (Pfi) constitutive mutants (files labeled MB),-results from aBSREL tests of episodic, diversifying selection on assimilated species (files labeled PS),-results from RELAX tests of weakened selection on assimilated species (files labeled RS),-phenotyping of mouth form in various experiments in Pfi and Pristionchus pacificus (Ppa) (files labeled PTYPE), and-geometric morphometrics of mouth form in spr-5 and wild-type lines (files labeled GM)-inferred potential effects of amino acid substitutions in Pristionchus bucculentus and Pristionchus elegans (IA)\nOther R, Excel or similar spreadsheet software, text editor\nTechnicalInfo A histone demethylase links the loss of plasticity to nongenetic inheritance and morphological change \u0026mdash; These data and R code correspond to -identification of morph-biased genes in Pristionchus fissidentatus (Pfi) constitutive mutants (files labeled MB), -results from aBSREL tests of episodic, diversifying selection on assimilated species (files labeled PS), -results from RELAX tests of weakened selection on assimilated species (files labeled RS), -phenotyping of mouth form in various experiments in Pfi and Pristionchus pacificus (Ppa) (files labeled PTYPE), and -geometric morphometrics of mouth form in spr-5 and wild-type lines (files labeled GM) -inferred potential effects of amino acid substitutions in Pristionchus bucculentus and Pristionchus elegans (IA) ## Description of the Data and file structure ### MB files * MB_Polyphenism.gene.lists.xlsx: Excel file with three tabs.

The dataset encompasses experimental data related to the fabrication of PEMs using tanfloc as either a polyanion or a polycation, expanding the versatility of this amphoteric polymer in PEM coatings. Typically, PEMs are formed by combining a polycation and a polyanion with complementary ionic groups. However, the unique amphoteric nature of tanfloc allows for the creation of PEMs utilizing only one of its functional groups, leaving the other functional group available for imparting antibacterial activity. The dataset includes details on the assembly of tanfloc-containing PEMs employing various counter-polyelectrolytes, including three poly-anionic glycosaminoglycans with varying charge densities, as well as the polycations N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan and polyethylenimine. The layer-by-layer assembly of PEMs is monitored using in situ Fourier-transform surface plasmon resonance (FT-SPR), confirming stable layer-by-layer construction. Surface chemistry is assessed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, this dataset provides insights into the biocompatibility of tanfloc-containing PEMs, demonstrating their support for mammalian cells. Most notably, the dataset includes extensive data on the antiadhesive and antibacterial properties of these coatings against common implant-associated pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial effects observed are attributed to electrostatic interactions and the polyphenolic nature of tanfloc.\nMethods 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR): Tanfloc (TAN) was characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy, recording spectra on a Bruker Neo US 400 NMR spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Solutions of TAN (tanfloc) with varying pH values (5, 6, 7.4, 8.4, and 9.3) were prepared and subjected to dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI). This characterization was performed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument from Malvern. Fourier-Transform Surface Plasmon Resonance (FT-SPR): The layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of PEMs on gold-coated glass chips was monitored in real-time using Fourier-Transform Surface Plasmon Resonance (FT-SPR). This involved modifying the gold-coated chips, flowing polycation, polyanion, and rinse solutions, and collecting data using an SPR-100 module coupled to a Nicolet 8700 FT-IR spectrometer. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Composition analysis of the PEMs was performed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). A survey scan was conducted over the energy range of 10 to 1100 eV, with high-resolution spectra obtained for the carbon (C1s), nitrogen (N1s), oxygen (O1s), and sulfur (S2p) envelopes. LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (ADSC cells): Human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) at passage 6 were cultured in Dulbecco\u0026rsquo;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1.0% penicillin/streptomycin. Sterilized samples were prepared and cells were seeded onto them. After 24 hours, culture media from each well were collected and subjected to the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay. This involved measuring absorbance at 490 nm and 680 nm using a plate reader (BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega). Control samples on polystyrene (PS) were included for comparison. Bacterial Growth Inhibition Assay: The antibacterial activity of different PEMs was assessed against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth media (NBM) and diluted to a concentration of 106 CFU/mL. Subsequently, 500 μL of the bacterial solution was exposed to the surfaces for 6 and 24 hours. After incubation, a 200 μL aliquot of the solution was extracted, and absorbance at 560 nm was measured using a plate reader. Control samples of glass and polystyrene (PS) were also included under identical conditions. Live-Dead Bacterial Cell Quantification: After incubation for 6 and 24 hours, bacterial adhesion to surfaces was visualized using fluorescence microscopy. The surfaces were stained and fixed before analysis. Live and dead bacterial percentages were determined using ImageJ software (n = 3).\nTechnicalInfo Dataset for Fabrication and Characterization of Antibacterial Coatings using an Amphoteric Condensed Tannin, Tanfloc. The dataset contains experimental data detailing the development and characterization of antibacterial polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings containing tanfloc, a natural condensed tannin polymer, as an amphoteric biomaterial. It includes results from biocompatibility assessments using human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and antibacterial activity assays against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the dataset provides insights into tanfloc hydrodynamic properties, the real-time assembly of PEMs via Fourier-Transform Surface Plasmon Resonance (FT-SPR), and PEM compositional analysis by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). N,N,N-Trimethyl chitosan is also characterized via 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy data quantifies live and dead bacterial adhesion, demonstrating the antibacterial efficacy of the coatings. These diverse datasets are valuable for research in biomaterials and antimicrobial coatings. ## Description of the data and file structure We\u0026rsquo;ve organized the data into seven main folders, each containing valuable information related to various experiments and analyses.

FT_SPR Data Explanation: The \u0026lsquo;FT_SPR\u0026rsquo; data sheet contains numerical values reflecting measurements obtained from specific software during the designated period. These values vary across different samples due to variations in sample properties and measurement conditions. It is important to note that null values in this data sheet correspond to cells in the Excel file that were not reported by the software. These null values indicate a lack of reported data for those specific cells. 2. Bacterial Growth Inhibition Data: The \u0026lsquo;Bacterial Growth Inhibition\u0026rsquo; data is quantified using absorbance values, which are obtained through a plate reader. This instrument measures the absorbance of solutions placed in a 96-well plate. It is essential to understand that empty cells in this dataset should not be filled by users. These empty cells represent instances where measurements were either not applicable or not obtained, and thus should be left as is to maintain the integrity of the dataset. 3. Live-Dead Bacterial Cell Data: For the \u0026lsquo;Live-Dead Bacterial Cell\u0026rsquo; data, an effort was made to measure the number of cells in at least five different areas for each sample. Depending on the sample characteristics, this measurement could either be limited to exactly five points or include more. To maintain clarity and consistency in our dataset, empty cells, where measurements were not possible or not taken, have been filled with null values by the authors.\nAccess Points https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.gqnk98sv9\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5061/dryad.gqnk98sv9/","summary":"Abstract This dataset presents comprehensive information on the development and characterization of antibacterial polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings incorporating tanfloc, a plant-derived condensed tannin polymer with inherent antimicrobial properties.

In many animals, growth-cessation is a consequence of hormone release that appears to be tied to attainment of particular body size or condition. Nevertheless, the size-sensing mechanism animals use to initiate hormone synthesis is poorly understood. Here we develop a simple mathematical model of growth cessation in Drosophila melanogaster, which is ostensibly triggered by attainment of a critical weight early in the last instar. Attainment of critical weight is correlated with synthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone, which causes a larva to stop growing, pupate and metamorphose into the adult form. Our model suggests that, contrary to expectation, the size-sensing mechanism that initiates metamorphosis occurs before the larva reaches critical weight; that is, the critical-weight phenomenon is a downstream consequence of an earlier size-dependent developmental decision, not a decision point itself. Further, this size-sensing mechanism does not require a direct assessment of body size, but emerges from the interactions between body size, ecdysone and nutritional signaling. Because many aspects of our model are evolutionarily conserved among all animals, the model may provide a general framework for understanding how animals commit to maturing from their juvenile to adult form.\nMethods The experimental data were collected as detailed in B. C. Stieper, M. Kupershtok, M. V. Driscoll, A. W. Shingleton, Imaginal discs regulate developmental timing in Drosophila melanogaster. Dev Biol 321, 18 26 (2008). The simulated data were generated using the deposited XPP-Auto and Simulink/Matlab scripts.\nTechnicalInfo A dynamical model of growth and maturation in Drosophila The data comprise experimental data used to parametrize the model, and example simulations generated by the model. The experimental data are the relationship between body mass (mg) and time to pupariation (TTP) for fed and starved third-instar Drosophila larvae (experimental_data_fed.csv and experimental_data_stvd.csv). The simulated data are the simulated relationship between body mass and TTP for fed and starved larvae without scatter (simulated_data_fed_ln.csv and simulated_data_stvd_ln.csv) and with scatter (simulated_data_fed_sct.csv and simulated_data_stvd_sct.csv). ## Description of the data and file structure All the data files contain two columns: one for body mass and a second for the time to pupariation in hours. ## Code/Software The R-script (Tyson_et_al_analysis.R) is the code used to analyze these data using loess regression and segmented regression. Script was prepared and run on R version 4.0.3. The XPP code to generate the ecdysone and growth dynamics is provided in Tyson_et_al_XPP.txt. Script was prepared and run on XPPAUT 8.0. The MatLab/Simulink model has two forms: one that generates the relationship between body mass and TTP without noise/scatter (single_run.m) and one that generates the same relationship but with scatter (multi_run.m). Both use the same core Simulink model (Model_simulink.slx). The scripts also generate plots of simulated versus experimental data for the relationship between body mass and TTP with and without scatter. The experimental data for these plots is contained in RealDatalmort.mat and are the same as the data used for the R-analysis. The matlab_workspace.mat file contains initial parameter values for the model. Parameter values can be specified within the single_run.m and multi_run.m scripts prior to running.

Lineage fusion (complete merging, resulting in a single panmictic population) is a special case of secondary contact that is seldom considered. Here, the circumstances under which lineage fusion can be distinguished from population size constancy, growth, bottleneck, and decline were investigated. Multi-locus haplotype data were simulated under models of lineage fusion with different divergence versus sampling lag times (D:L ratios). These pseudo-observed datasets also differed in their allocation of a fixed amount of sequencing resources (number of sampled alleles, haplotype length, number of loci). Distinguishability of lineage fusion versus each of 10 untrue non-fusion scenarios was quantified based on six summary statistics (neutrality tests). Some datasets were also analyzed using extended Bayesian skyline plots. Results showed that signatures of lineage fusion very closely resemble those of decline—high distinguishability was generally limited to the most favorable scenario (D:L = 9), using the most sensitive summary statistics (FS and ZnS), coupled with the optimal sequencing resource allocation (maximizing number of loci). Also, extended Bayesian skyline plots often erroneously inferred population decline. Awareness of the potential for lineage fusion to carry the hallmarks of population decline is critical.\nMethods All pseudo-observed datasets (PODs) were simulated in DIY-ABC v2.1.0 (Cornuet et al., 2014) using the HKY model of nucleotide sequence evolution (Hasegawa et al., 1985) with proportion of invariant sites = 10% and gamma = 2.0, and a mutation rate (µ) of 1×10-7 substitutions per site per generation. Summary statistic distributions were estimated via 1,000 simulations using the “Coalescent Simulations (n-loci | 1-pop)” feature in DnaSP V6.12.03 (Rozas et al., 2017). Simulations were seeded using values for θ per gene (Watterson, 1975), number of sampled individuals, DNA sequence haplotype length, and number of diploid autosomal loci from the associated POD. A subset of PODs were analyzed using Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots (EBSPs; Heled \u0026amp; Drummond, 2008), implemented in BEAST V2.7.3 (Bouckaert et al., 2014), using the true model nucleotide sequence evolution and mutation rate that generated the PODs, clock model = strict, operator weights = auto-optimized, with other priors as default.

PODs were simulated under four alternative lineage fusion scenarios that differed in their pre-fusion divergence time vs. post-fusion sampling lag time (D:L ratios = 1, 3, 5 or 9), each represented by a different folder. See that main for full details on simulation parameter settings. Hierarchically nested subfolders then partition PODs according number of sampled alleles (n#), followed by haplotype alignment length in base pairs (#bp) and number of independent diploid autosomal loci (#loc). PODs are provided in .alleles format, which are compatible with DnaSP V6.12.03 (Rozas et al., 2017). Note that there are five replicate PODs for datasets containing 40 sampled alleles (n40) coupled with 50 loci (50loc), as this expanded set was used for demographic hypothesis testing (e.g., Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot [EBSP] analyses; Heled \u0026amp; Drummond, 2008).

Pseudo-observed datasets (PODs) were simulated under four alternative lineage fusion scenarios that differed in their pre-fusion divergence time vs. post-fusion sampling lag time (D:L ratios). Data associated with each these are contained within a separate worksheet: DL1, DL3, DL5 and DL9. Within a worksheet, each POD and demographic scenario are labeled with the following elements: DL ratio (DL#), number of sampled alleles (n#), haplotype alignment length in base pairs (#bp), number of independent diploid autosomal loci (#loc), and demographic scenario under which summary statistic distributions were estimated via the Coalescent Simulations (n-loci | 1-pop) feature in DnaSP V6.12.03 (Rozas et al., 2017), seeded using basic characteristics of a given POD. These scenarios are abbreviated as follows: size constancy (Const), growth (Grow, with suffix 2, 3 or 4 indicating intensity of 2, 3, or 4 of the base Ne), bottleneck (Bott, with suffix 2, 3 or 4 indicating intensity of 0.5, 0.33, or 0.25 base Ne), decline (Decn, with suffix 2, 3 or 4 indicating intensity of 0.5, 0.33, or 0.25 base Ne), or lineage fusion (Fuse, the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; scenario). Within a worksheet, the estimated 90% CI for each of six summary statistics (see Table S1 associated with the main text for explanation of notation) is reported as the lower 5% and upper 95% bound. The proportion (Prop.) of the lineage fusion (Fuse) scenario\u0026rsquo;s 90% CI that is unique (Unq), compared to a given non-fusion scenario\u0026rsquo;s 90% CI, was calculated in two steps: first at the lower tail (Lower Unq), and then at the upper tail (Upper Unq). Two these two proportions were then summed to generate the total (Tot) proportion of the lineage fusion scenario\u0026rsquo;s 90% CI that is unique.

Lineage fusion (complete merging, resulting in a single panmictic population) is a special case of secondary contact that is seldom considered. Here, the circumstances under which lineage fusion can be distinguished from population size constancy, growth, bottleneck, and decline were investigated. Multi-locus haplotype data were simulated under models of lineage fusion with different divergence versus sampling lag times (D:L ratios).","title":"Data from: Genetic signatures of lineage fusion closely resemble population decline"},{"content":"Abstract Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) that integrate presence-only and presence-absence data offer a promising avenue to improve information on species’ geographic distributions. The use of such ‘integrated SDMs’ on a species range-wide extent has been constrained by the often-limited presence-absence data and by the heterogeneous sampling of the presence-only data. Here, we evaluate integrated SDMs for studying species ranges with a novel expert range map-based evaluation. We build a new understanding about how integrated SDMs address issues of estimation accuracy and data deficiency and thereby offer advantages over traditional SDMs. Location South and Central America. Time period 1979-2017. Major taxa studied Hummingbirds. Methods We build integrated SDMs by linking two observation models – one for each data type – to the same underlying spatial process. We validate SDMs with two schemes: i) cross-validation with presence-absence data and ii) comparison with respect to the species’ whole range as defined with IUCN range maps. We also compare models relative to the estimated response curves and compute the association between the benefit of the data integration and the number of presence records in each data set. Results The integrated SDM accounting for the spatially varying sampling intensity of the presence-only data was one of the top-performing models in both model validation schemes. Presence-only data alleviated overly large niche estimates, and data integration was beneficial compared to modelling solely presence-only data for species that had few presence points when predicting the species’ whole range. On the community level, integrated models improved the species richness prediction. Main conclusions Integrated SDMs combining presence-only and presence-absence data are successfully able to borrow strengths from both data types and offer improved predictions of species’ ranges. Integrated SDMs can potentially alleviate the impacts of taxonomically and geographically uneven sampling and to leverage the detailed sampling information in presence-absence data.\nMethods A detailed methodology associated with the environmental variables and species data can be found from the references used in the original publication.\nTechnicalInfo This data set is a collection of publicly available species and environmental data. They have been used to study populations and distributions of species and their associations with environment. To avoid risks on species populations, coordinates of the presence records for three species with near-threatened IUCN status and all checklist coordinates have been rounded to 0.01 degrees. The species are Little Woodstar (Chaetocercus bombus), Black-thighed Puffleg (Eriocnemis derbyi) and Hoary Puffleg (Haplophaedia lugens). ## Description of the data and file structure * File 1 Name: Cloud_cover/MODCF_intraannualSD_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 1 Description: Intra-annual variability of cloud cover in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * Folder 2 Name: Domains_new/ * Folder 2 Description: Folder contains geotif-file for each species showing the study domain, which is a buffer around species expert range map and points records. * File 3 Name: Elevation_range/topography_elevation_1KMmi_GMTEDmi_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 3 Description: Areal elevation from sea level in meters in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * File 4 Name: Environment/Chelsa_SA.tif * File 4 Description: Chelsa Bioclim (v. 1.2) of annual mean temperature (cov1), mean annual diurnal range (cov2), mean annual precipitation sum (cov3) and precipitation seasonality (cov4) in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 5 Name: EVI/Annual_EVI_resampled_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 5 Description: Enhanced vegetation index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 6 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/Sites_8Feb2011.csv * File 6 Description: List of checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * CommunityName: name of communities * LatDecDeg: latitude in geographical coordinates * LongDecDeg: longitude in geographical coordinates * Country: country * MinElevation_m: minimum elevation from sea level in meters * MaxElevation_m: maximum elevation from sea level in meters * AreaSampled: sampled area in square meters * AllSpp: number of species recorded * SppWithPhy: number of species recorded with phylogenetic information * SppWithMorph: number of species recorded with morphological information * File 7 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/SpeciesxSite8Feb2011.csv * File 7 Description: List of species sightings in the checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * Spname: Species name * CommunityName: name of communities * Country: country * SpID: identifying number of species * Folder 8 Name: PO_observations_non_thinned/ * Folder 8 Description: Folder contains species point records as species-specific CSV files. * Columns: * lat: latitude in geographical coordinates * lon: longitude in geographical coordinates * Folder 9 Name: Study_area/ * Folder 9 Description: Folder contains study area (rectangle with the extent matching the extent of the union of all species domains) in geographical (WGS 84) and planar (laea) coordinate system. * File 10 Name: TRI/tri_1KMmd_GMTEDmd_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 10 Description: Topographical ruggedness index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * Folder 11 Name: Compiled_data_v9/ * Folder 11 Description: Folder contains two .RData-files for two example species, Coeligena lutitae (Buff-winged starfrontlet) and Ensifera ensifera (Sword-billed hummingbird).

Peptide co-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of two different peptides into a supramolecular architecture. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the effect of anionic amino acid type on co-assembly dynamics and nanofiber structure in binary CATCH(+/-) peptide systems. CATCH peptide sequences follow a general pattern: CQCFCFCFCQC, where all C’s are either a positively charged or a negatively charged amino acid. Specifically, we investigate the effect of substituting aspartic acid residues for the glutamic acid residues in the established CATCH(6E-) molecule, while keeping CATCH(6K+) unchanged. Our results show that structures consisting of CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D-) form flatter β-sheets, have stronger interactions between charged residues on opposing β-sheet faces, and have slower co-assembly kinetics than structures consisting of CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6E-). Knowledge of the effect of sidechain type on assembly dynamics and fibrillar structure can help guide the development of advanced biomaterials and grant insight into sequence-to-structure relationships.\nMethods Please refer to the manuscript for details.

The coordinate files have a mdcrd file extension. For traditional MD simulations, the files are labeled equil40.mdcrd, signifying the 40th equilibration run, corresponding to 200 ns. For REMD (replica exchange molecular dynamics), the files are labeled remd.310K.mdcrd corresponding to the system at T = 310 K. Paired with each coordinate file is a parameter-topology file with a prmtop file extension. Both coordinate and parameter-topology files are contained in the same directory for each peptide system. ### PRIME20 discontinous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations PRIME20/DMD simulations produce two main files used for analysis: coordinate files with a pdb file extensions, and data files specifying hydrogen bonding partners with a bptnr file extension. Coordinate files follow the standard Protein Data Bank file format. Data files regarding hydrogen bonding partners with a bptnr extension contain a single column of integers. The first row corresponds to the collision number, the following rows corresponds to the index of the hydrogen bonding partner. As an example, consider the following snippet: run0509.bptnr 100 30 62 ... In this data file, we are given the hydrogen bonding information for collision number 100. The 1st coarse-grained bead is hydrogen bonded to the 30th coarse-grained bead. The 2nd coarse-grained bead is hydrogen bonded to the 62nd coarse-grained bead, and so forth. Hydrogen bonding information is automatically calculated and outputed as part of the PRIME20/DMD software package. ## Description of scripts and software used for simulation analysis and the resulting output data analysis files Here we describe the scripts and software used to analyze the outputs of molecular dyanamics simulations. All molecular dynamics simulations are run using AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) software. CPPTRAJ is a program within AMBER used to proccess coordinate trajectories and data files. CPPTRAJ is the main tool used to analyze our simulation outputs. Generally, the AMBER20 package was used for MD simulation and analysis. Tools and packages availaible within CPPTRAJ and AMBER are dependent on the system administrator and the installation process chosen for the AMBER package. Instructions for installing AMBER is beyond the scope of this README file. Each analysis/calculation is done independently of one another. As such, a general workflow for each analysis can be described as follows: 1. Data Preparation - i.e. running the desired simulation 2. Running CPPTRAJ or MM/GBSA 3. Results 4. Interpretation For ease of reading and comprehension, the following subsections are organized as follows: * subtitle describing calcuation or analyis * a manual page link for commands used, provided as a reference for the user\u0026rsquo;s curiosity, and to properly cite where variable descriptions are quoted from * a generic example of an input script used for calculation * command used to submit a script * an example and description of the resulting output file Ellipses ... are used to indicate that a section of text has been omitted for conciseness. ### Contact map calculation nativecontacts manual page\\ input: contacts.in parm 6K6D-01/6K6D.prmtop # loading parameter-topology file trajin 6K6D-01/equil40.mdcrd # loading coordinate file nativecontacts name 6K6D-01 !(:NME,ACE,WAT) byresidue # calling nativecontacts run # running command The nativecontacts command has the following syntax: nativecontacts [name ] [] [byresidue] where:\\ [name ] Data set name.\\ First mask to calculate contacts for.\\ `[byresidue]` Write out the contact map by residue instead of by atom. ``` cpptraj \u0026amp;lt; contacts.in ``` **output**: *native.6K6D-01*, *nonnative.6K6D-01* for native and nonnative contacts, respectively ``` #Residue Residue Contacts 2.000 2.000 0.0000 3.000 2.000 23.5760 4.000 2.000 15.1536 5.000 2.000 68.7520 6.000 2.000 1.0392 7.000 2.000 0.0608 8.000 2.000 0.0000 9.000 2.000 0.0000 10.000 2.000 0.0000 ``` Where the first two columns are the first and second residue number, and Contacts is the total number of contacts involved with the residue pair. ### DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis [secstruct manual page](https://amberhub.chpc.utah.edu/secstruct/)\\ **input**: *sec.in* ``` parm 6D.prmtop # loading parameter-topology file trajin remd.310K.mdcrd # loading coordinate file secstruct dssp out dssp.out # calling secstruct command run # running command ``` The secstruct command has the following syntax: ``` secstruct [name ] [out ] ``` where:\\ `[name ]` Data set name.\\ `[out ]` Output file name for secondary structure vs time. ``` cpptraj \u0026amp;lt; sec.in ``` **output**: *dssp.out.sum* ``` #Residue Extended Bridge 3-10 Alpha Pi Turn Bend 1 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 2 0.0000 0.0008 0.1359 0.0627 0.0000 0.1930 0.0000 3 0.0001 0.0003 0.1987 0.1758 0.0001 0.2521 0.0000 4 0.0000 0.0002 0.2674 0.2691 0.0002 0.2407 0.0978 5 0.0000 0.0010 0.2312 0.3669 0.0003 0.2470 0.0895 6 0.0001 0.0003 0.2033 0.4286 0.0004 0.2069 0.0851 7 0.0001 0.0003 0.1797 0.4604 0.0005 0.2190 0.0901 8 0.0000 0.0003 0.1653 0.4666 0.0005 0.2095 0.0682 9 0.0000 0.0001 0.1695 0.4298 0.0004 0.2475 0.1008 10 0.0001 0.0001 0.1689 0.3286 0.0003 0.2957 0.0911 11 0.0001 0.0008 0.1297 0.2081 0.0002 0.3507 0.0000 12 0.0001 0.0006 0.0722 0.1153 0.0001 0.2881 0.0000 13 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 ``` Where #Residue is the residue number, Extended is the total fraction of extended structure vs time, Bridge is the total fraction of bridge structure vs time, and so forth. ### Hydrogen bonding analysis [hbond manual page](https://amberhub.chpc.utah.edu/hbond/)\\ [avg manual page](https://amberhub.chpc.utah.edu/avg/)\\ **input**: *hbond_calc.in* ``` parm 6K6E-01/6K6E.prmtop # loading parameter-topology file trajin 6K6E-01/equil40.mdcrd # loading coordinate file hbond 6K6E-01 donormask :157-468\u0026amp;amp;:LYS acceptormask :157-468\u0026amp;amp;:GLU,ASP nointramol # calling hbond command run # running command avg 6K6E-01[UU] out hb_avg_summary.out # calculating average of 6K6E-01[UU] dataset and writing average to hb_avg_summary.out ``` The hbond command has the following syntax: ``` hbond [name ] [donormask [acceptormask ] [nointramol] ``` where:\\ `[name ]` Data set name.\\ `[donormask ]` Use atoms in as solute donor heavy atoms.\\ [acceptormask ] Use atoms in as solute acceptor atoms.\\ `[nointramol]` Ignore intramolecular hydrogen bonds. ``` cpptraj \u0026amp;lt; hbond_calc.in ``` **output**: *hb_avg_summary.out* ``` #Set [avg] [sd] [ymin] [ymax] [yminidx] [ymaxidx] [names] 1 133.4 7.493 111 156 814 1046 \u0026quot;6K6E-01[UU]\u0026quot; ``` where:\\ `[avg]` Average of each set.\\ `[sd]` Standard deviation of each set.\\ `[ymin]` Y minimum of each set.\\ `[ymax]` Y maximum of each set.\\ `[yminidx]` Index of minimum Y value.\\ `[ymaxidx]` Index of maximum Y value.\\ `[names]` Name of each set.

In the descriptions the \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; is used as a wildcard character to be interpreted as a possible string of characters. ### annealing-catch-repo.tar.gz The annealing-catch-repo.tar.gz tarball contains files pertaining to atomistic MD simulations (using the AMBER forcefield) of single bilayer and two stacked bilayer structures of CATCH peptides. Each simulation had an annealing stage prior to equilibration. The directory annealing-catchff14SB contains the subdirectories n12L2 and n12L4 which correspond to the single bilayer result files and stacked bilayer result files, respectively. The subdirectory structures contains the starting structures for each simulation. Within n12L2 and n12L4 are subdirectories that are labeled systematically based on the CATCH system and the simulation run number, for example \u0026ldquo;4K4D-01\u0026rdquo; refers to the CATCH(4K+/4D-) system and is the 1st in a triplicate of simulations. Each directory that is labeled by a CATCH system name contains generally the following: the topology file (.prmtop extension), the input coordinates (.rst7 extension), along with the final simulation coordinates (equil.mdcrd and equil*.pdb). For more information regarding these files, please refer to the AMBER manual. Within n12L2 are subdirectories regarding analysis of the results. n12L2analysis contains outputs from MMGBSA (FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat), LIE analysis (lie.out), results for calculating the number of salt bridges (sb), and results for calculating the number of backbone (bb) and intramolecular (intra) hydrogen bonds (hb). The n12L2contacts directory contains results for calculating the number of native and nonnative contacts within each simulation system. Within n12L4 are subdirectories regarding analysis of the results. The n12L4/hb_analysis contains results for calculating the number of hydrogen bonds. The n12L4/contacts directory contains results for calculating the number of native and nonnative contacts within each simulation system. The n12L4/results directy contains results of MMGBSA analysis. The n12L4/sb_analysis contains results of calculating the number of salt bridges within a system. Inputs for MMGBSA and LIE analysis can be found in the n12L2 and n12L4 and are labeled mmgbsa.in and lie.in, respectively. . └── annealing-catchff14SB ├── n12L2 │ ├── 4K4D-01 │ │ ├── 4K4D.prmtop │ │

Peptide co-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of two different peptides into a supramolecular architecture. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the effect of anionic amino acid type on co-assembly dynamics and nanofiber structure in binary CATCH(+/-) peptide systems. CATCH peptide sequences follow a general pattern: CQCFCFCFCQC, where all C’s are either a positively charged or a negatively charged amino acid.","title":"Data from: programming co-assembled peptide nanofiber morphology via anionic amino acid type: insights from molecular dynamics simulations"},{"content":"Abstract Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated. We analyzed phosphorus (P) inputs (fertilization and atmospheric deposition) and outputs (harvest and leaching losses) over seven years in three representative biomass crops—switchgrass (Panicum virga­tum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) and hybrid poplar trees (Populus nigra X P. maximowiczii) – as well as in no-till corn (maize; Zea mays L.) for comparison, all planted on former cropland in SW Michigan, USA. Only corn received P fertilizer. Corn (grain and stover), switchgrass, and miscanthus were harvested annually, while poplar was harvested after six years. Soil test P (STP; Bray-1 method) was measured in the upper 25 cm of soil annually. Harvest P removal was calculated from tissue P concentration and harvest yield (or annual woody biomass accrual in poplar). Leaching was estimated as total dissolved P concentration in soil solutions sampled beneath the rooting depth (1.25 m), combined with hydrological modeling. Fertilization and harvest were by far the dominant P budget terms for corn, and harvest P removal dominated the P budgets in switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar, while atmospheric deposition and leaching losses were comparatively insignificant. Because of significant P removal by harvest, the P balances of switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar were negative and corresponded with decreasing STP, whereas P fertilization compensated for the harvest P removal in corn, resulting in a positive P balance. Results indicate that perennial crop harvest without P fertilization removed legacy P from soils, and continued harvest will soon draw P down to limiting levels, even in soils once heavily P-fertilized. Widespread cultivation of bioenergy crops may therefore alter P balances in agricultural landscapes, eventually requiring P fertilization, which could be supplied by P recovery from harvested biomass.\nAccess Points https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dfn2z355r\nRelated Identifiers IsCitedBy https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.13020 ","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z355r/","summary":"Abstract Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated.

In the genomes of at least some vertebrate taxa, an important form of mutation bias involves changes at CpG dinucleotides: If the DNA nucleotide cytosine (C) is immediately 5’ to guanine (G) on the same coding strand, and if the C is methylated, then C→T and G→A mutations occur at an elevated rate relative to mutations at non-CpG sites. Here we examine experimental data from case studies in which it has been possible to identify the causative substitutions that are responsible for adaptive changes in the functional properties of vertebrate hemoglobin (Hb). Specifically, we examine the molecular basis of convergent increases in Hb-O2 affinity in high-altitude birds. Using a data set of experimentally verified, affinity-enhancing mutations in the Hbs of highland avian taxa, we tested whether causative changes are enriched for mutations at CpG dinucleotides relative to the frequency of CpG mutations among all possible missense mutations. The tests revealed that a disproportionate number of causative amino acid replacements were attributable to CpG mutations, demonstrating that mutation bias can influence outcomes of molecular adaptation.\nTechnicalInfo README for supplementary data from Storz, et al.

The gold standard of sampling microbiomes directly from captured animals is ideal for limiting potential abiotic influences on microbiome composition, yet fails to leverage the many benefits of non-invasive sampling. Application of microbiome-based monitoring for rare, endangered, or elusive species creates a need to non-invasively collect scat samples shed into the environment. Since controlling sample age is not always possible, the potential influence of time-associated abiotic factors was assessed. To accomplish this, we analyzed partial 16S rRNA genes of fecal metagenomic DNA sampled non-invasively from Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) near Yellowstone National Park. We sampled pellet piles from four different elk, then aged them in a natural forest plot for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days, with triplicate samples at each time point (i.e., a blocked, repeat measures (longitudinal) study design). We compared microbiomes of each elk through time with point estimates of diversity, bootstrapped hierarchical clustering of samples, and a version of ANOVA–simultaneous components analysis (ASCA) with PCA (LiMM-PCA) to assess the variance contributions of time, individual and sample replication. Our results showed community stability through days 0, 1, 3 and 7, with a modest but detectable change in abundance in only 2 genera (Bacteroides and Sporobacter) at day 14. The total variance explained by time in our LiMM-PCA model across the entire 2-week period was not statistically significant (p\u0026gt;0.195) and the overall effect size was small (\u0026lt;10% variance) compared to the variance explained by the individual animal (p\u0026lt;0.0005; 21% var.). We conclude that non-invasive sampling of elk scat collected within one week during winter/early spring provides a reliable approach to characterize microbiome composition in a 16S rDNA survey and that sampled individuals can be directly compared across unknown time points with minimal bias. Further, point estimates of microbiome diversity were not mechanistically affected by sample age. Our assessment of samples using bootstrap hierarchical clustering produced clustering by animal (branches) but not by sample age (nodes). These results support greater use of non-invasive microbiome sampling to assess ecological patterns in animal systems.\nMethods 1.1 Sample collection Scat samples from 4 elk were collected near the northern boundary of Yellowstone National Park in Montana in March 2016. Animal sampling was conducted non-invasively within 15 minutes of defecation. Elk sex and age could not be accurately determined due to these samples being collected after observing the elk defecating from a distance using binoculars. Based on our observations, they were most likely adult females or young males. Fecal samples from each scat pile (i.e., individual) were collected from the ground with sterile gloves and forceps and placed in sterile whirl-pak sample bags. Sample whirl-paks were placed on wet ice in a cooler in the field for transportation to the experimental site. The experimental site was located on a sparsely forested plot near Evaro, MT with conditions known to be suitable as elk habitat, at approximately 4000 ft elevation. Three pellets from each animal were frozen at -20° C after arriving at the experimental site approximately 6 hours post-defecation. This initial subsample represents time-point zero samples (and technical replicates) with minimal exposure to ambient conditions typical of a direct or capture-based sampling scheme. The remaining pellets from each elk were placed in square plastic culture plates (25 cm x 25 cm) with a grid backing using sterile gloves and forceps. Each culture plate had a larger glass plate suspended above it at a height of 4 cm using a cork stopper in each corner to allow air flow and prevent direct contact with incidental precipitation (although no precipitation occurred on-site during the study), and the group of culture plates was surrounded by protective wire fencing. One plate was used for each technical replicate, with each replicate plate containing samples from all four individuals (for photos of the enclosure and a schematic of the experimental layout see Supplemental Figure 1). The samples were exposed to ambient conditions from March 27th through April 9th (14 days). Three samples from each elk were removed from the replicate plates after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days and immediately frozen at ‑20° C after removal from ambient conditions. A total of 60 elk pellets were experimentally collected. Temperature was logged in 10-minute increments during the study using Thermocron temperature loggers (OnSolution Pty Ltd, Australia) distributed above and below the culture plates and shielded from direct sunlight. The temperature data were aggregated into hourly oscillations, daily max and minimum, and a smoothed average temperature. Additional temperature recordings were obtained from a NOAA weather station (Point 6, MT) 3.5 miles and 4000 ft above our site as reference. 1.1 Sample preparation, DNA extraction and sequencing Frozen elk fecal pellets (stored frozen at -20° C) were prepared for DNA extractions by separating a standard weight (250 mg) cross-section from each pellet using a sterile petri dish (10 cm) and sterile safety razor blade for each sample. This fraction was placed into a designated sample tube from the Qiagen PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD) and processed using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The resulting purified metagenomic DNA was eluted with 100 µL PCR-grade water and stored at -20° C prior to further analysis. To assess the bacterial community present in the fecal DNA extraction, we used a generally-conserved (i.e., “universal”) 16S/18S barcoded primer set (536F and 907R) designed to amplify the V4 and V5 variable regions of the rRNA gene (Holben et al., 2004) and PCR using 1mL of elk fecal sample metagenomic DNA standardized to 25ng/mL as template. Once amplified, samples were gel purified using the QIAGEN Gel Purification kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for downstream direct sequencing. An Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, CA, USA) was used to obtain 300 base-pair (bp) paired-end sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit.\nTechnicalInfo Data from: Wildlife fecal microbiota exhibit community stability across a longitudinal semi-controlled non-invasive sampling experiment Data overview: Directory contains 120 paired-end gzipped FASTQ files from Illumina MiSEQ paired-end 300 bp sequencing prior to any manipulation. Each file responds to a sequenced 16S metabarcoded bacterial community from an elk fecal pellet. This study consisted of 4 elk, repeatedly sampled across 5 time points (Day 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14) in triplicate for a total of 60 sampling points. Each sampling point has a forward and reverse read file for a total of 120 paired files. Also included is a tab separated mapping file (.txt) identifying file names with associated sample information. Study results can be found in the Frontiers in Microbiomes publication. A brief overview is included below. Study purpose: We designed an experiment to quantify the potential bias of sample age (i.e. time since defecation) on fecal microbiota of a North American ungulate, where sampling takes place in late winter/early spring conditions, typically within a 2-4 day window. The purpose was to assess potential community compositional changes through time that might confound experimental observations and interpretation when samples come from an unknown timeline. We sampled fecal pellets from four Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) non-invasively, but at the time of defecation, near Yellowstone National Park, Montana in March 2016. The longitudinal component of this fecal microbiota experiment was conducted in a forested plot near Evaro, MT beginning on the day of collection after transporting the fecal pellet samples in sterile whirl-pak bags on ice. In our design, sample age is controlled by repeatedly subsampling elk fecal pellets originally sampled from the same individual across day 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14, in triplicate. Thus, our hierarchical block experimental design captures compositional fecal microbiota change through time within four elk biological replicates (blocks) and estimates the variation within each block using three technical replicates for each sample/time combination. File naming scheme: Files are named in order starting with project \u0026ldquo;ETS\u0026rdquo; (Elk Time Series) followed by a combined digit block beginning with sample age [0-14] (1or 2 digits), elk individual biological replicate [1-4], and technical replicate [1-3], with dot separated forward (.1) or reverse (.2) reads. Example, \u0026ldquo;ETS_1442.1.fq.gz\u0026rdquo; is Day [14], Elk [4], Rep [2], forward read (.1) gziped fastq file (.fq.gz).

These trade-offs may constrain the ability of populations to exhibit fast growth rates under water limitation and high cover of neighbors. However, traits that confer drought tolerance may also confer resistance to competition. It remains unclear how fitness responses to these abiotic conditions and biotic interactions combine to structure grassland communities and how this relationship may change along a gradient of water availability. To address these knowledge gaps, we estimated the low-density growth rates of populations in drought conditions with low neighbor cover and in ambient conditions with average neighbor cover for 82 species in six grassland communities across the Central Plains and Southwestern United States. We assessed the relationship between population tolerance to drought and resistance to competition and determined if this relationship was consistent across a precipitation gradient. We also tested whether population growth rates could be predicted using plant functional traits. Across six sites, we observed a positive correlation between low-density population growth rates in drought and in the presence of interspecific neighbors. This positive relationship was particularly strong in grasslands of the northern Great Plains but weak in the most xeric grasslands. High leaf dry matter content and low (more negative) leaf turgor loss point were associated with high population growth rates in drought and with neighbors in most grassland communities. Synthesis: A better understanding of how both biotic and abiotic factors impact population fitness provides valuable insights into how grasslands will respond to extreme drought. Our results advance plant strategy theory by suggesting that drought tolerance increases population resistance to interspecific competition in grassland communities. However, this relationship is not evident in the driest grasslands where aboveground competition is likely less important. Leaf dry matter content and turgor loss point may help predict which populations will establish and persist based on local water availability and neighbor cover, and these predictions can be used to guide the conservation and restoration of biodiversity in grasslands.\nMethods Cover data These data include a subset of 82 species (113 species-site combinations) that were monitored annually as part of the Extreme Drought in Grasslands Experiment (EDGE). Topographically unform and hydrologically isolated plots were set up across six grassland types (tallgrass prairie, southern mixed-grass prairie, northern mixed-grass prairie, northern shortgrass prairie, southern shortgrass prairie, and desert grassland) and absolute cover of all species in four 1 x 1 m quadrats was estimated yearly from 2012–2017. At each site, ten control plots at each site received ambient rainfall over the experimental period, and ten treatment plots experienced a 66% reduction in growing season precipitation (equivalent to roughly 40–50% over the whole year) using greenhouse rainout shelters equipped with strips of clear corrugated polycarbonate. Additional site and experimental design details are available in Griffin‐Nolan et al., (2019). Population growth rates Percent cover was used as a measure of population size for each species at the quadrat level. Population growth rate at time t was calculated as the total cover of a species in time t+1 divided by the total cover in time t. The natural logarithm of this value (intrinsic rate of increase) for a species in a quadrat describes whether the population increased (positive value) or decreased (negative value) in the transition from year t to t+1. Population growth rates were calculated for each species in each quadrat in each annual transition. Because we use species cover instead of counts of individuals to measure population size, intraspecific cover is equal to the cumulative cover of a species in a quadrat. Interspecific cover in each quadrat is defined as the cumulative cover of all non-focal species in a quadrat. We calculated low-density growth rates for populations of each species at each site to assess fitness in two different conditions: mean neighbor abundance under ambient rainfall and minimum neighbor abundance under extreme drought. Minimum and mean neighbor abundances were averaged across all five years of the experiment. To estimate these growth rates, we fit linear models predicting intrinsic rate of increase for each species in each grassland as a function of drought treatment, intraspecific neighborhood cover, and interspecific neighborhood cover across years. Functional traits Species-level trait data were assembled from several publications and trait databases and these eleven included leaf dry matter content (LDMC; g g-1), average individual leaf area (cm2), leaf turgor loss point (TLP; MPa), leaf nitrogen concentration (%), specific leaf area (SLA; cm2 g-1), leaf tissue density (LTD; cm3 g-1), root nitrogen (%), root tissue density (RTD; cm3 g-1), root diameter (mm), specific root length (SRL; m g-1), and average maximum height (mm). Trait data were compiled for each species at the site level where available (Table S1). Trait values measured at, or nearby, EDGE sites were considered the closest estimate for species traits. For this we used a mix of unpublished and open-access trait data from individual researchers (Blumenthal et al., 2020; Craine et al., 2011; Farrell, 2018; Laughlin et al., 2010; Stears et al., 2022; Tucker, 2010). Grassland communities that did not have data available at the local scale were filled in by progressively broader estimates using regional averages and eventually global estimates provided by the TRY database as needed (Kattge et al., 2019).\nTechnicalInfo Drought tolerant grassland species are generally more resistant to competition These data were analyzed and presented in the accompanying paper where we observed a positive correlation between low-density population growth rates in drought and low-density population growth rates in the presence of interspecific neighbors. We also found that high leaf dry matter content and low (more negative) leaf turgor loss point were associated with higher population fitness in drought and with higher neighbor competition.

These trade-offs may constrain the ability of populations to exhibit fast growth rates under water limitation and high cover of neighbors. However, traits that confer drought tolerance may also confer resistance to competition. It remains unclear how fitness responses to these abiotic conditions and biotic interactions combine to structure grassland communities and how this relationship may change along a gradient of water availability.","title":"Drought tolerant grassland species are generally more resistant to competition"},{"content":"Abstract The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorizes states to create early intervention (EI) programming to provide developmental and therapeutic services to infants and toddlers with a developmental condition; EI programs are mandated to report on child and family outcomes for purposes of accountability and quality improvement.

T., K. D. Dickerson, D. K. Blackman, N. Randolph-Flagg, C. R. German, and C. Sotin (2024), Sustained hydrothermal circulation under ocean-world gravity, J. Geophys. Res. - Planets, submitted and in review. Plain language summary from paper: Ocean worlds are planets, moons, and other rocky bodies that have a liquid ocean, often under an icy shell or within the rocky interior. In our solar system, ocean worlds include several moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Some of these ocean worlds are thought to have active hydrothermal circulation, where water, rocks, and heat combine to drive fluids in and out of the seafloor. Hydrothermal circulation could impact the chemistry of the water, rock, and ice of ocean worlds and provide chemical energy that allows life to develop deep below the icy surface. This study shows results from computer simulations of hydrothermal circulation, using a well-understood system on Earth as the basis for comparison to conditions on an ocean world that has much lower gravity (because it is smaller than Earth). The simulations show that fluid flow much like that occurring at seafloor sites on Earth could occur under ocean world gravity, but with several important differences. Lower gravity results in less buoyancy, where warmed fluid expands and becomes lighter than nearby cold fluid. Less buoyancy tends to reduce flow rates in a hydrothermal system, and this can result in higher temperatures of the circulating fluid, and more extensive chemical reactions. Lower gravity can also result in hydrothermal systems transporting less heat, and this could allow these systems to last longer on an ocean world.\nMethods There is a README file with information on files posted, and a Supporting Information document that goes with the paper that discusses modifications to code in some detail.

One such development is the emergence of automated tracking systems, which enable the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal information for animals. Although tag-based tracking systems provide valuable insights into animal movement and collective behavior, the attachment of devices can have detrimental effects in some cases. Here, we investigated the effects of recently developed miniature tracking tags using the rock ant, Temnothorax rugatulus, as a model system. To do so, we compared the foraging activities of tagged ants and untagged ants (who lost their tags) within initially fully-tagged colonies. Additionally, we compared the foraging activities of these initially fully-tagged colonies with those of no-tag control colonies (no one was tagged). We found that tags did not significantly reduce individual activity, with tagged ants visiting the food source as frequently as untagged ants within initially fully-tagged colonies. However, our analysis revealed a marked difference in recruitment behavior—tagged ants were less likely to participate in tandem runs than untagged ants. Furthermore, the number of tandem runs was higher for the no-tag control colonies than the initially fully-tagged colonies, in which 69–95% of colony members had tags. Our data suggest, for the first time, that tracking tags can negatively impact ant behavior. Although tracking devices are powerful tools for understanding complex behavioral patterns, it is crucial to carefully consider their potential impact on animal behavior to ensure accurate conclusions.\nMethods Three colonies of ants were tagged prior to foraging experiments (Initially Fully-Tagged: \u0026lsquo;R2119\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;R2111\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;R2100\u0026rsquo;).

Several possible solutions have emerged using sensors ranging from RGB cameras, depth sensors, millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radars, and wearable inertial sensors. Despite previous efforts on datasets and benchmarks for HPE, few datasets exploit multiple modalities and focus on home-based health monitoring. To bridge this gap, we present mRI, a multi-modal 3D human pose estimation dataset with mmWave, RGB-D, and Inertial Sensors. Our dataset consists of over 5 million frames from 20 subjects performing rehabilitation exercises and supports the benchmarks of HPE and action detection. We perform extensive experiments using our dataset and delineate the strength of each modality.

The summary-based methods, which first infer gene trees independently and then combine them, are much more scalable but are prone to gene tree estimation error, which is inevitable when inferring trees from limited-length data. Gene tree estimation error is not just random noise and can create biases such as long-branch attraction. Results: We introduce a scalable likelihood-based approach to co-estimation under the multi-species coalescent model. The method, called quartet co-estimation (QuCo), takes as input independently inferred distributions over gene trees and computes the most likely species tree topology and internal branch length for each quartet, marginalizing over gene tree topologies and ignoring branch lengths by making several simplifying assumptions. It then updates the gene tree posterior probabilities based on the species tree. The focus on gene tree topologies and the heuristic division to quartets enables fast likelihood calculations. We benchmark our method with extensive simulations for quartet trees in zones known to produce biased species trees and further with larger trees. We also run QuCo on a biological dataset of bees. Our results show better accuracy than the summary-based approach ASTRAL run on estimated gene trees. Availability and implementation: QuCo is available on https://github.com/maryamrabiee/quco.

At each site, a soil Megapit is dug in the dominant soil type to a maximum depth of 2 m. On the exposed face of the soil pit, a tape measure visually divides the soil profile into 10 cm depth increments. Each soil pit has three vertically-oriented sampling profiles, roughly corresponding to the left, center, and right of the pit sampling face. These profiles are referred to as profile number 1, 2 and 3, respectively. From each profile, a block of soil is removed from each 10 cm depth increment, starting from the surface down to 100 cm. Once a depth of 100 cm is reached, the each profile is divided into 20 cm depth increments. By the end of sampling, up to 45 soil samples are collected, 15 per profile. Roots are sieved and then divided into four categories distinguishing between status (alive or dead) and size (\u0026gt; 2mm and \u0026lt; 2 mm, unless otherwise noted). Once roots are weighed and dried, they are sent to an external laboratory for analysis of carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotopes.

Despite the importance of autumn migration, few studies have conceptualized resource tracking of temperate herbivores during this critical season. We adapted the Frost Wave Hypothesis (FWH), which posits that animals pace their autumn migration to reduce exposure to snow but increase acquisition of forage. We tested the FWH in a population of mule deer in Wyoming, USA by tracking the autumn migrations of n = 163 mule deer that moved 15–288 km from summer to winter range. Migrating deer experienced similar amounts of snow but 1.4–2.1 times more residual forage than if they had naïve knowledge of when or how fast to migrate. Importantly, deer balanced exposure to snow and forage in a spatial manner. At the fine scale, deer avoided snow near their mountainous summer ranges and became more risk-prone to snow near winter range. Aligning with their higher tolerance of snow and lingering behavior to acquire residual forage, deer increased stopover use by 1 ± 1 day (95% CI) day for every 10% of their migration completed. Our findings support the prediction that mule deer pace their autumn migration with the onset of snow and residual forage but refine the FWH to include movement behavior en route that is spatially dynamic.\nMethods Animal capture and handling From 2014–2020, we captured n = 220 adult female mule deer (\u0026gt;1-yr-old) in the Red Desert via helicopter net-gunning (LaSharr et al., 2022). We outfitted all deer with store-on-board or iridium GPS collars that collected locations every 1–2 hours (Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc., Isanti, MN, USA; LOTEK Wireless Inc., New Market, Ontario, CAN; Telonics Inc, Mesa, AZ, USA). We used GPS data from a previous study on the Sublette Herd (2011–2013; Sawyer et al., 2016) to analyze movement for an additional n = 27 adult female mule deer (\u0026lt; 1 yr old; n = 66 animal-years) which were outfitted with store-on-board GPS collars that collected locations every 3 hours (Telonics, Mesa, AZ, USA). All animal capture and handling protocols were approved by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (Chapter 33-937) and an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wyoming (Protocol 20131111KM00040, 20151204KM00135, 20170215KM00260, 20200302MK00411). Classification of migratory tactics and delineation of seasonal ranges We used net squared displacement (Bunnefeld et al., 2011) to determine start and end dates of migration, delineate migratory routes, and calculate net displacement between each GPS location and the start location of autumn migration. We used 95% kernel utilization distributions (Worton, 1989) to delineate summer ranges (end of spring migration–start of autumn migration). Following methods from Sawyer et al. (2016), we classified migratory tactics based on migration distance and where deer spent summer. Movement rate and stopover use For each animal-year, we divided migration distance (km; Euclidean distance between first and last locations of autumn migration) by duration to determine hourly and daily rates of movement. We used a 10% utilization distribution from a Brownian bridge movement model (Horne et al., 2007) to delineate high-use stopovers (≥ 3 days of use; Rodgers et al., 2021). Because some animals moved back and forth between adjacent stopovers, we aggregated stopovers that were within a 5-km radius to reduce probability of overestimating stopover use.

Sexual mimicry is beneficial when it increases reproductive success. We explored the function of a novel form of sexual mimicry in the courtship display of male Enchenopa treehoppers. Males produce plant-borne vibrational advertisement signals, to which females respond. Interestingly, males also produce a female mimic signal, and we experimentally tested its function. First, with a female priming hypothesis, we tested if this signal would increase female response. However, females were as likely to respond to playbacks with or without this. Second, with a male inhibition hypothesis, we tested if the mimic signal would inhibit competing males. However, males were as likely to produce displays after playbacks with or without the mimic signal. Third, with a self-boost hypothesis, we tested if males performing the mimic signal would show higher signaling effort. Males that produced the mimic signal had higher signal rates and longer signals than males that did not produce it. We suggest that the mimic signal provides the males with positive motivational feedback. Consequently, the evolution of sexual mimicry –and signal repertoires– may be influenced by the effects on the sender itself, besides the effects on the audience.\nMethods We used laser vibrometry to record the signaling displays of male treehoppers and the responses of females to artificial playbacks transmitted through the plant.\nTechnicalInfo The function of the female mimic signal in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers ## Description of the data and file structure FILE: Female female-like_signal function OVERALL DESCRIPTION: This file contains the data for the experimental test of the female-like signal in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers.

Recordings: The sound recordings of the experiment testing the function of the female-like signal. The recordings are sorted by species and then by sex. All individuals were presented with one stimulus, which is noted towards the end of the file name. The four-digit code at the end of the file name represents the recording ID which can also be found -and matched- with the spreadsheets. The folder contains a subsample of ~25% of all the recordings obtained for the experiments, and ~15% of the spontaneous signaling displays of males. The rest of the recordings are available upon contacting the authors, as the recordings are part of ongoing unpublished projects in the research groups.\nAccess Points https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078/D1QF08\n","permalink":"https://datapurifier.github.io/landingpage-in-a-box/10.6078/d1qf08/","summary":"Abstract Some animals mimic behaviors or signals of conspecifics while courting. Sexual mimicry is beneficial when it increases reproductive success. We explored the function of a novel form of sexual mimicry in the courtship display of male Enchenopa treehoppers. Males produce plant-borne vibrational advertisement signals, to which females respond. Interestingly, males also produce a female mimic signal, and we experimentally tested its function. First, with a female priming hypothesis, we tested if this signal would increase female response.","title":"The function of the female mimic signal in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers"},{"content":"Abstract Extreme weather events perturb ecosystems and increasingly threaten biodiversity1. Ecologists emphasize the need to forecast and mitigate the impacts of these incidents, which requires knowledge of how risk is distributed among species and environments, but the scale and unpredictability of extreme events complicates assessment1–4. These challenges are compounded for large animals (‘megafauna’), which play crucial ecological roles but are hard to study5. Traits such as body size, dispersal ability, and habitat affiliation are among the hypothesized determinants of animals’ vulnerability to natural hazards1,6,7. However, it has rarely been possible to test these propositions or, more generally, to link short- and longer-term effects of weather-related disturbance8,9. Here, we show how large herbivores and carnivores in Mozambique responded to Intense Tropical Cyclone Idai, the deadliest storm on record in Africa, across scales ranging from individual decisions in the hours after landfall to community-level responses nearly 20 months later. Animals occupying low-elevation habitats exhibited strong spatial responses to rising floodwaters. Body size predicted species’ subsequent numerical responses: small-bodied species exhibited the greatest population declines. We trace this sensitivity to limited mobility, which increased likelihood of death during the flood and constrained animals’ capacity to withstand food shortages afterward. Our results identify potentially general trait-based mechanisms underlying animal responses to severe weather and may help to inform strategies for wildlife conservation in a volatile climate.

Data were generated via DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples in three distinct seasons for large herbivores (late-wet, early-dry, and late-dry) and opportunistically for wild dogs. The methods summary below is from Walker et al. (2023); please see that paper for additional details, references, and context. All filtered datasets used in Walker et al. 2023 are deposited here alongside raw DNA metabarcoding data for African wild dog diets and large-herbivore diets in late-wet season 2018 and all seasons in 2019. Raw data for large-herbivore diet datasets also used in Walker et al. (2023) can be found in the following repositories: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sxksn02zc (2018, early- and late-dry season); https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.brv15dvcj (2016, early-dry season). DNA metabarcoding analysis of wild dog diets. Samples were collected on an opportunistic basis with unused nitrile gloves and placed in an unused plastic bag. Sampling date and location were recorded on the bag, which was placed on ice for transport to the field laboratory. There, samples were frozen at -20° C until processing. Every three months, all samples collected from the intervening period were thawed and preprocessed for DNA extraction. Sample preprocessing involved homogenizing each thawed sample by massaging the bag between thumb and forefinger. A pea-sized subsample was then transferred into a plastic tube containing silica bashing beads and 750uL of buffer (Xpedition Lysis/Stabilization Solution; Zymo Research, CA, USA). We then capped the tube and vortexed it for 30 s to break apart the subsample, exposing it to the buffer. Samples were heat treated at 72° C for 30 min as an antiviral precaution (a step mandated by the US Department of Agriculture for most herbivore species, described below) before being refrozen at -20° C for transport to Princeton University. In a Biosafety Level 2 facility at Princeton University dedicated to fecal DNA analysis, we extracted DNA from the samples using Zymo Quick-DNA Soil/Fecal Microbe MiniPrep kits(Zymo Research, CA, USA) following manufacturer instructions. DNA extractions comprised batches of 29 samples (wild dog samples were extracted as part of a broader extraction session involving other species) and one negative extraction control (750uL DNA lysis buffer). Extracted DNA was compiled onto two 96-well plates for amplification. Before proceeding with DNA amplification, we first standardized DNA concentrations across samples using the Quant-iT Picogreen assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) to quantify DNA concentrations and adding nucleic-acid-free water (Qiagen, MD) to dilute high-concentration samples. We amplified the mitochondrial 16S gene to amplify mammal DNA using an established primer pair (MamP007F, 5’-CGAGAAGACCCTATGGAGCT-3’; MamP007R, 5’-CCGAGGTCRCCCCAACC-3’) 1. To multiplex PCR products, we tagged the forward and reverse primers with 8-nt tags that each differed by at least 4 nt to distinguish samples after sequencing. To limit amplification of wild dog DNA, we used a blocking primer (5’-GGAGCTTTAATTAACTAACCCAAGCTTACGG-3’) with a C3-spacer added to the 3’ end and a six-base overlap with MamP007F (first six bases of primer sequence, underlined). PCRs contained 2μL of extracted DNA, 0.5U of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, MA), 0.2μg BSA (New England Biolabs, MA), 0.2μM of each primer, 0.2mM of each dNTP (New England Biolabs, MA), 2mM MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems, MA), 1X GeneAmp PCR Buffer II (Applied Biosystems, MA), and 2μM of the blocking primer, with a final volume of 20μL. Thermocycling conditions were: initial denaturing (95° C, 10 min), 45 cycles of denaturing (95° C, 30 s), annealing (52° C, 30 s), elongation (72° C, 30 s), and a final extension (72° C, 7 min). All PCRs were performed in triplicate and included negative extraction controls, negative PCR controls, and positive PCR controls (where DNA template was provided as a sequence designed in silico to comprise: 5’-10 random bases, MamP007F, a 75-base random barcode, MamP007R, 10 random bases-3’). We confirmed successful amplification of the barcode using gel electrophoresis. We pooled PCR products by plate and purified them with a MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, MD). Purified PCR products from each plate were submitted for sequencing as equimolar libraries to the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, where Illumina tags were appended with a low-cycle PCR approach and libraries were sequenced in paired-end (2×150bp) on a NovaSeq SP 300-nt. Forward and reverse reads were paired using OBITools’ illuminapairedend command (minimum score = 40) 2. Sequences were then assigned to the samples they came from (ngsfilter; up to two errors allowed), while sequences that were unaligned, contained ambiguous bases, or were outside the expected barcode length (\u0026lt; 40 or \u0026gt; 140 bp) were removed. Identical sequences were aggregated (obiuniq) and any sequences with only one read in the dataset (i.e., singletons) were removed (obigrep -p ‘count\u0026gt;1’). Taxonomic identifiers were assigned to each sequence using the ecotag command and a 16S reference database created using in silico PCR and the EMBL taxonomic library (release 143). Only sequences belonging to Mammalia (taxonomic ID: 40674) were retained in the dataset. We removed putative chimeras (sequences with \u0026lt; 80% match to reference database) and PCR errors, which were identified using the obiclean command (parameters: -d 1; -r 0.25). Sequences with highest abundance in controls were considered contaminants and removed. PCR replicates were removed if their read depth fell below a critical threshold (1000 reads), or if they were above the 95th quantile for contaminant read abundance.Consistency among PCR replicates was confirmed by comparing their composition. If inter-replicate dissimilarity was greater than the 95th quantile of inter-replicate dissimilarity, or if an inter-replicate comparison fell within the distribution of inter-sample dissimilarity, it was removed. When two or more PCR replicates remained in the dataset, their composition was averaged to give the mean scat-level sequence composition. Finally, we limited the data to sequences that had a perfect match to the reference database and removed sequences accounting for \u0026lt; 1% of each sample’s relative read abundance (RRA) to reduce the likelihood of false positives 3,4. Secondary predation (i.e., detecting prey of prey) is unlikely in this dataset because wild dog prey were almost exclusively plant-eating ungulates. DNA metabarcoding analysis of herbivore diets. Fecal samples were collected by driving Gorongosa’s road network and collecting samples from defecating ungulates. Additional samples were collected from animals immobilized for GPS-collaring 5-8. For each sample, we recorded the GPS coordinates of the defecation site and a classification of the surrounding habitat type. Other field handling and preprocessing protocols were as described above for wild dogs. Samples were subjected to an antiviral treatment (72°C for 30 minutes) before import into the United States, as mandated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA/AHPIS/VS permit #130123 to R.M.P.). On arrival at Princeton University, we extracted DNA from each sample as described above for wild dogs (batches of 29 samples, one extraction control containing lysis buffer only) using Zymo Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Mini Prep kits (Zymo Research, CA, USA). DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing was done in batches corresponding to each sampling period. Extracted DNA from samples was organized into 96-well PCR plates. To limit large differences in post-PCR DNA concentrations, we quantified and standardized the concentration of DNA in samples collected in 2018 and 2019 using Quant-iT Picogreen (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples with high concentrations were diluted using nucleic-acid-free water. In triplicate for each sample, we amplified the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron (and the g and h primers designed for it), a widely used barcode for degraded plant DNA, using primers with a unique 8-nt tag at the 5’ end that enabled pooling of uniquely identifiable PCR products for sequencing in a single high-throughput run 9. PCRs included negative controls (nucleic-acid-free water), negative extraction controls, and positive controls (2016 only). PCR mixtures comprised 2 μl of DNA extract, 0.5U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, 0.17 mg ml −1 of BSA, 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM of MgCl2 , 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1XGeneAmp PCR buffer II in a final reaction volume of 20 μL. Thermocycling conditions were: initial denaturing (95° C for 10 min); 35 cycles of denaturing (95° C, 30 seconds), annealing (55° C, 30 seconds), and extension (72° C, 30 seconds); final elongation (72° C, 2 min). We confirmed successful amplification with gel electrophoresis, and PCR products were pooled by plate and purified using MinElute PCR Purification kits. Purified PCR products were then pooled into sequencing libraries, ensuring equimolarity. Sequencing libraries were prepared with a PCR-free approach (2016) or low-cycle PCR (2018, 2019) by the Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, and paired-end sequencing (2×150bp) was performed on Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq 2500 platforms. We processed sequence data for each collection period using the OBITools package 2. These procedures were similar as described above for wild dogs. Briefly, we assembled paired-end reads (illuminapairedend; arguments: \u0026ndash;sanger –score-min=40), assigned reads to the samples they came from (ngsfilter; arguments: -e 2), and merged unique sequences (obiuniq). We discarded sequences with a low alignment score, ambiguous nucleotides, unexpected barcode length (\u0026lt; 8 or \u0026gt; 180 nt), and \u0026lt; 10 reads across the dataset. We then aligned the remaining sequences to identify sequence variants (obiclean; arguments: -d 1 -r 0.25) and removed sequences that were identified more often as variants of dominant sequences rather than dominant sequences themselves or singular sequences (without variants present). We assigned taxonomic identities to the remaining sequences with primary reference a local plant DNA database based on vouchered specimens collected in Gorongosa 10. When the local-library assignment score was \u0026lt; 98%, we used secondary comparisons to a global database compiled from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (release 143) and local databases of plants from Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and Laikipia, Kenya 11 for taxonomic identification. Sequence variants identified by obiclean were retained in the dataset if they perfectly matched a referencesequence in the local Gorongosa reference database. Finally, we removed putative contaminants (sequences most abundant in negative controls) and chimeras (sequences that had a \u0026lt; 80% match in the reference databases). Last, PCR replicates were retained if they were within the 95th quantile of inter-replicate dissimilarity, did not fall within the distribution of inter-sample dissimilarities, and were below the 95th quantile of putative contaminant and chimera abundance. Samples were retained if they had \u0026gt; 1 replicate remaining after this procedure. We then averaged the number of reads across all retained PCR replicates for each sample and removed molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) accounting for \u0026lt; 1% of reads per sample, following the approach that we have used in previous studies from this system 10,12. While there are multiple approaches to dealing with low-abundance reads in metabarcoding, per-sample proportional abundance thresholds are one of the simplest and most effective 4. We tested the sensitivity of our results to removing this threshold and found that while this increased the number of unique sequences by two orders of magnitude (implausibly relative to the estimated number of plant taxa in our study area), it did not qualitatively alter our results for the abundance-weighted dietary metrics that we analyze. Finally, we rarified sample read depth to 1,250 reads to facilitate comparisons among samples and converted mOTU-by-sample matrices into proportional abundance (relative read abundance, RRA) of each plant mOTU per sample. We use RRA data for inference given that RRA of the trnL-P6 marker (i) provides a reasonable approximation of proportional consumption 13-15, (ii) has yielded inferences in our previous studies that qualitatively match those based on presence-absence data 10,12,15, and (iii) provides a fuller and more accurate characterization of population-level diets than presence-absence data 16,17. Confirming species identities for a subset of herbivore fecal samples. For a subset of fecal samples, our field notes recorded uncertainties in the herbivore species’ identity. Typically this arose from unusual dung morphology or difficulty locating a dung pile after directly observing defecation. For this subset of samples, we amplified the 16S mitochondrial barcode (MamP007F, MamP007R primers) used to analyze wild dog diets to identify the herbivore species of the sample. As described above, the primers were tagged on the 5’ end with 8-nt identifiers that each differed by at least 4-nt. We used the same PCR mixture and thermocycling conditions reported above for wild dog diet analysis. After confirming amplification with gel electrophoresis, we pooled and purified the PCR products using the MinElute PCR Purification kit. Purified DNA was combined in equimolar proportions into two sequencing libraries and submitted to the Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, where Illumina tags were appended with a low-cycle PCR approach and libraries were sequenced in paired-end (2×150bp) on a NovaSeq SP 300 nt. As for diet datasets, sequences were filtered using OBITools following the same procedure outlined above (paired-end reads assembled with illuminapairedend, sequences assigned to samples with ngsfilter, sequences dereplicated with obiuniq) 2. As for the wild dog diet filtering, sequences outside the expected 40–140 bp range, with low alignment scores, or with ambiguous nucleotides were discarded. Sequence variants were identified with obiclean and only dominant or singular variants were retained. Taxonomic identifiers were associated with sequences using the global reference database for mammals that we compiled with in silico PCR from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory release 143. Following ref. 10, we used five criteria to assign identities to the remaining samples: (1) the sample had \u0026gt; 350 mammalian reads, (2) the most common sequence accounted for ≥50% reads, (3) most common sequence matched a reference database sequence with ≥98%, (4) only one Latin binomial name was associated with that most common sequence, (5) that most common sequence was at least twice as common as the second most common. Samples were discarded if they failed two of these criteria; for the remainder, the most common sequence was assigned as the sample identity.

Ecol. 31, 1615-1626 (2022).\nTechnicalInfo Trait-based sensitivity of large mammals to a catastrophic tropical cyclone: DNA metabarcoding data This dataset contains raw and filtered sequence data derived from metabarcoding DNA extracted from the dung of large herbivores and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) from Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. Alongside these diet-data files, there are files matching a sample\u0026rsquo;s original name (i.e., that used in the raw diet data files) with its corrected name (i.e., that used in the filtered data files), which derive from genetically testing the samples. It also contains a file describing the use of the floodplain habitat by large herbivore species in Gorongosa National Park, which are derived from aerial count data (see Walker et al. 2023). ## Description of the data and file structure ##### Raw Diet Data Files Relevant Files: Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateWet_2018_Raw.fastq.gz; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateWet_2019_Raw.fastq.gz; Herbivore_Diet_Data_EarlyDry_2019_Raw.fastq.gz; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateDry_2019_Raw.fastq.gz; African_Wild_Dog_Diet_Data_Raw.fastq.gz File Structure: Files are compressed FASTQ files that can be expanded using the \u0026lsquo;gunzip\u0026rsquo; command. These FASTQ files store raw DNA sequence data for each fecal-sample collection period (herbivore diets) and a single combined sequence dataset for African wild dog (AWD) diet data. These files contain unfiltered DNA sequences of the P6 loop of the trnL (UAA) intron (herbivore diets) and the 16S region (AWD diets). In all cases, pair-end sequences were first aligned using the OBITools command \u0026ldquo;illuminapairedend\u0026rdquo; (arguments: \u0026ndash;sanger \u0026ndash;score-min=40 -r) and fecal sample identities were associated with sequences using the \u0026ldquo;ngsfilter\u0026rdquo; command in the same program (arguments: -e 2). No other processing or filtering has been done. Each sequence record contains the DNA sequence, its length, dual-index tag identities, primers used, quality and matching scores, and the fecal sample the sequence was retrieved from. All downstreaming processing steps for these raw data files are described in the Methods section of Walker et al. 2023. ##### Filtered Herbivore Diet Data Files Relevant Files: Herbivore_Diet_Data_EarlyDry_2016_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateWet_2018_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_EarlyDry_2018_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateDry_2018_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateWet_2019_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_EarlyDry_2019_Filtered.txt; Herbivore_Diet_Data_LateDry_2019_Filtered.txt File Structure: Filtered herbivore diet data tables are tab-delimited files describing both the composition of herbivore diets in each period and the best matches between the retrieved sequences and DNA reference databases (described in Methods). The two facets of the data table can be separated into separate objects in the R statistical software using the ROBITools package and its \u0026ldquo;import.metabarcoding.data\u0026rdquo; function to read the data tables. One of these tables (i.e., the \u0026lsquo;reads\u0026rsquo; slot in S4 class R parlance) has fecal samples in the rows and molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs; the DNA sequences that passed bioinformatic filtering steps) in the columns. mOTUs are referred to by their sequence \u0026lsquo;id\u0026rsquo; in the column names. Each element in this table reports the proportional contribution (i.e., relative read abundance) of each mOTU in the plant DNA extracted from each fecal sample. Rows sum to 1. The second table (i.e., the \u0026lsquo;motus\u0026rsquo; slot in the data object) describes each mOTU found in the set of fecal samples from which DNA was extracted. This table has mOTUs in the rows (identified and matched with the @reads table via the \u0026lsquo;id\u0026rsquo; column) and columns reporting the degree of matching between each mOTU and reference databases, prevalence in the dataset, and bioinformatic filtering scores. Column names containing capitalized three-letter codes (i.e., \u0026lsquo;PNG\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;GNP\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;SER\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;MRC\u0026rsquo;) report the results of matching each mOTU to a specific DNA reference library. PNG refers to the Gorongosa National Park reference library; SER refers to Serengeti National Park; MRC refers to Mpala Research Center, Kenya; GDB refers a global database based on the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database. Columns report the following data for each mOTU (* indicates more than one column that the description applies to): id: sequence identity, matches column names in @reads table best_identity*: the best proportional match between the mOTU and a reference sequence best_match*: the identifier for the reference sequence best matching the mOTU count: the number of times the mOTU occurred in the sequencing dataset scientific_name*: the most specific taxonomy identity attributable to the mOTU based on matching reference sequences species_list*: the species records from the reference set that best match the mOTU sequence: the mOTU\u0026rsquo;s nucleotide sequence db_ok: the reference database (PNG, GDB, MRC, SER) that an mOTU was preferentially matched to bid_ok: the best proportional match between the mOTU and a sequence in the preferred database *_ok: hierarchical taxonomic identifiers for each mOTU based on matching to the preferred database ##### Herbivore Sample Identity Testing Files Relevant Files: Herbivore_Dung_Samples_Unidentified.csv; Heribivore_Dung_Samples_Positively_Identified.csv File Structure: Samples that were collected in the field but unable to be assigned with high confidence to one species are listed in the first file (Herbivore_Dung_Samples_Unidenitifed) under the column \u0026lsquo;SampleID\u0026rsquo;, which is the only column in the comma-delimited file. These samples are present in the \u0026ldquo;Raw\u0026rdquo; data files but were removed from the \u0026ldquo;Filtered\u0026rdquo; data files and are not included in Walker et al. (2023) analyses. The second file (Herbivore_Dung_Samples_Positively_Identified) is a two-column, comma-delimited file reporting the original sample name (\u0026lsquo;SampleID\u0026rsquo; column) and the large-herbivore species that sample was identified to originate from (\u0026lsquo;TopSeqSpeciesID\u0026rsquo; column). Names of samples correctly identified in the field did not change; names of those incorrectly identified in the field were corrected to the applicable herbivore-species code (see below) for analyses and inclusion in the \u0026lsquo;Filtered\u0026rsquo; data files. ##### Filtered African Wild Dog Diet Data Files Relevant Files: African_Wild_Dog_Diet_Data_Filtered.csv File Structure: Comma-delimited file contains 42 rows (wild dog fecal sampling events) and 18 columns (reporting the composition of those fecal samples and when they were collected). The first column (\u0026lsquo;Date\u0026rsquo;) reports time to/since Cyclone Idai landfall when the fecal-sampling event occurred. The remaining columns (Tragelaphus.sylvaticus to Loxodonta.africana) report the proportion of reads from each fecal-sampling event attributed to each prey species. ##### Metadata Files Relevant Files: Herbivore_Floodplain_Use.csv; Kingdon_bodymass.csv; six files starting with \u0026ldquo;adonis_pairwise\u0026rdquo; File Structure: Comma-delimited files. Herbivore_Floodplain_Use.csv contains three columns: COUNT_YEARS, SPECIES, PROP_IN_FLOODPLAIN. The first column reports the aerial surveys of large herbivores in Gorongosa National Park that these data derive from. The second reports the species name associated with each floodplain-use value. The third reports the proportion of individuals of each species that were observed in the floodplain habitat of Gorongosa National Park. Kingdon_bodymass.csv contains two columns: Species, Kingdon_bodymass. The first reports the species name; the second reports its mean adult body mass in kilograms per Kingdon\u0026rsquo;s Mammals of Africa. Files beginning with the \u0026ldquo;adonis_pairwise\u0026rdquo; prefix are pre-processed data files containing results of the R function adonis2 (package vegan) run on each pair of species in each time period (one time period per file). Because each species has a differing number of samples at each time point, we randomly selected samples, ran adonis2, and repeated this procedure 1000 times for each pair of species in each collection period. As such, each collection-period specific file contains the following columns: \u0026lsquo;CP\u0026rsquo; = collection period identity; \u0026lsquo;Iteration\u0026rsquo; = permutation number for that species pair (1:1000); \u0026lsquo;Species1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Species2\u0026rsquo; = the species pair; \u0026rsquo;nSamples1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;nSamples2\u0026rsquo; = number of samples from each species used in that permutation of the analysis; \u0026lsquo;F\u0026rsquo; = F-statistic as returned by vegan::adonis2; \u0026lsquo;R2\u0026rsquo; = R-squared statistic returned by vegan::adonis2; \u0026lsquo;P\u0026rsquo; = p-value returned by vegan::adonis2; \u0026lsquo;adjP\u0026rsquo; = repeated-tests adjusted p-value, adjusted using Holm method. Compressed Directories Relevant Files: png_shp.zip; Antelope_MCP.zip; New_Flood.zip Directory Structure: Each directory contains geospatial files necessary to analyze Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for Gorongosa at the two scales tested in the study (i.e., within the network of flood sensors and within the maximum-convex polygon occupied by GPS-collared antelope). The analysis script is also provided (NDVI_Analysis.r) and these files are used by that script. Analysis Scripts Relevant Files: NDVI_analysis.r; GrassComposition_analysis.r; NicheOverlap_analysis.r; Help_functions.r; DietQuality_analysis.r; DietDiversity_analysis.r File Structure: Each file is an R script and includes data processing and analysis code used to produce results presented in the manuscript. Code is commented. For NDVI_Analysis.r, users need to download the Gorongosa shapefile from the World Database of Protected Areas and MODIS data with the MODIStsp package in R. DietDiversity_analysis.r requires users to read in the provided metadata files on floodplain use and species\u0026rsquo; mean body mass. NicheOverlap_analysis.r requires users to read in provided pre-analyzed data files (each beginning with \u0026lsquo;adonis_pairwise\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;), code used to produce these files is provided within this script. DietQuality_analysis.r requires users to download data on plant nutritional traits from , files required from this repository are listed in the script. The HelpFunctions.r script provides user-defined R functions that facilitate data processing. ##### Key to Species Naming Conventions in Diet Data Files LYPI = African Wild Dog (Lycaon pictus) KOEL = Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) AEME = Impala (Aepyceros melampus) OUOU = Oribi (Ourebia ourebi) REAR = Reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) HINI = Sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) SYCA = Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) ALBU = Hartebeest (Alcephalus buselaphus) COTA = Blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) LOAF = Savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) TRST = Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) TRAN = Nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) TRSC = Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus/sylvaticus) PHAF = Warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) ## Sharing/Access information Analyses in the manuscript also use data quantifying plant nutrition.
