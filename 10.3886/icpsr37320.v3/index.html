This study collected information from Young Childrenâ€™s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM e-PRO) on home, environment, and community participation, involvement, and desired change. Measurements were also collected from the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT e-PRO) on mobility, social cognitive, and daily activities domains. The Child Outcomes Summary (COS) was used to capture functional performance related to having positive social relationships, acquiring and using knowledge and skills, and taking appropriate action to meet needs. Early Intervention Service Use measured EI intensity, whether child received specific services including physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech therapy (ST), psychology, or developmental intervention (DI), and the total number of service hours received within each discipline.

Service coordinators then approached eligible caregivers on their caseloads, when the child was within a month of their next annual review of progress. Eligible and interested caregivers were directed to a study website to confirm their study eligibility per the inclusion criteria. Caregivers who provided informed consent online proceeded to complete an online demographic questionnaire, followed by an electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) assessment of their childâ€™s participation in home and community activities. After completion of the e-PRO assessment, participants were asked to indicate their availability for having a second e-PRO administered to them via iPad and over the telephone. Once they confirmed their availability, each caregiver received immediate access to an online report summarizing their responses to share with their childâ€™s EI team.\nMethods Presence of Common Scales: Young Childrenâ€™s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM e-PRO) Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT e-PRO) Child Outcome Summary (COS)\nMethods A total of 163 families were enrolled in the study between March 2017 and August 2018, with a final enrollment of 149 (139 English, 10 Spanish). Each caregiver confirmed his or her eligibility online by verifying that they fit the study inclusion criteria. For the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory - Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT e-PRO) measurement, 8 of the 139 families declined consent and 16 were lost to follow-up. Consequently, 115 families completed the PEDI-CAT e-PRO. Similarly, Child Outcomes Summary (COS) scores are not recorded for all early intervention (EI) enrolled children in this dataset. This is because the EI program did not routinely capture COS data electronically during the entire study period. The existing dataset is therefore available as either the whole sample or as the sub-sample of children with complete PEDI-CAT e-PRO and COS information.\nTableOfContents Datasets: DS0: Study-Level Files DS1: Early Intervention Dataset DS2: Strategies Dataset\nMethods Caregivers that were at least 18 years old; could read, write, and speak English or Spanish; had internet access; and had a child between 0-3 years old who was deemed early intervention service eligible for at least 3 months.\nMethods AVTCASI; record abstracts; web-based surveyThe survey instruments used in this study are not available as part of this data collection.

<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorizes states to create early intervention (EI) programming to provide developmental and therapeutic services to infants and toddlers with a developmental condition; EI programs are mandated to report on child and family outcomes for purposes of accountability and quality improvement.

The researchers for this study partnered with a large urban EI program in Colorado that had recently transitioned to electronic data capture and was implementing a statewide initiative to facilitate function-focused care with individual families and paired collected electronic patient-reported outcomes (e-PRO) data with EI administrative data on child and family characteristics and service use to more fully examine EI service adequacy relative to patient-important outcomes.
