      <description>Abstract The decision to stop growing and mature into an adult is a critical point in development that determines adult body size, impacting multiple aspects of an adultâ€™s biology. In many animals, growth-cessation is a consequence of hormone release that appears to be tied to attainment of particular body size or condition. Nevertheless, the size-sensing mechanism animals use to initiate hormone synthesis is poorly understood. Here we develop a simple mathematical model of growth cessation in Drosophila melanogaster, which is ostensibly triggered by attainment of a critical weight early in the last instar.</description>

      <description>Abstract IPUMS USA contains harmonized census and American Community Survey (ACS) data from 1790 to the present. For the period 1850 to 1940, IPUMS includes 100% of individuals in the decennial censuses. For the period 1950 to 2010, we have public use samples of decennial censuses. For the period since 2000, IPUMS provides annual ACS public use samples. The available information in the censuses and ACS varies by year, but generally includes basic housing data (type of housing, household appliances, and housing characteristics), demographic data (age, race, sex, marital status, and relationship to the head of household), economic data (occupation, industry, income, work status), and other individual characteristics (migration, disability, veteran status).</description>
