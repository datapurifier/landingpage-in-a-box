The use of such ‘integrated SDMs’ on a species range-wide extent has been constrained by the often-limited presence-absence data and by the heterogeneous sampling of the presence-only data. Here, we evaluate integrated SDMs for studying species ranges with a novel expert range map-based evaluation. We build a new understanding about how integrated SDMs address issues of estimation accuracy and data deficiency and thereby offer advantages over traditional SDMs. Location South and Central America. Time period 1979-2017. Major taxa studied Hummingbirds. Methods We build integrated SDMs by linking two observation models – one for each data type – to the same underlying spatial process. We validate SDMs with two schemes: i) cross-validation with presence-absence data and ii) comparison with respect to the species’ whole range as defined with IUCN range maps. We also compare models relative to the estimated response curves and compute the association between the benefit of the data integration and the number of presence records in each data set. Results The integrated SDM accounting for the spatially varying sampling intensity of the presence-only data was one of the top-performing models in both model validation schemes. Presence-only data alleviated overly large niche estimates, and data integration was beneficial compared to modelling solely presence-only data for species that had few presence points when predicting the species’ whole range. On the community level, integrated models improved the species richness prediction. Main conclusions Integrated SDMs combining presence-only and presence-absence data are successfully able to borrow strengths from both data types and offer improved predictions of species’ ranges. Integrated SDMs can potentially alleviate the impacts of taxonomically and geographically uneven sampling and to leverage the detailed sampling information in presence-absence data.\nMethods A detailed methodology associated with the environmental variables and species data can be found from the references used in the original publication.\nTechnicalInfo This data set is a collection of publicly available species and environmental data. They have been used to study populations and distributions of species and their associations with environment. To avoid risks on species populations, coordinates of the presence records for three species with near-threatened IUCN status and all checklist coordinates have been rounded to 0.01 degrees. The species are Little Woodstar (Chaetocercus bombus), Black-thighed Puffleg (Eriocnemis derbyi) and Hoary Puffleg (Haplophaedia lugens). ## Description of the data and file structure * File 1 Name: Cloud_cover/MODCF_intraannualSD_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 1 Description: Intra-annual variability of cloud cover in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * Folder 2 Name: Domains_new/ * Folder 2 Description: Folder contains geotif-file for each species showing the study domain, which is a buffer around species expert range map and points records. * File 3 Name: Elevation_range/topography_elevation_1KMmi_GMTEDmi_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 3 Description: Areal elevation from sea level in meters in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * File 4 Name: Environment/Chelsa_SA.tif * File 4 Description: Chelsa Bioclim (v. 1.2) of annual mean temperature (cov1), mean annual diurnal range (cov2), mean annual precipitation sum (cov3) and precipitation seasonality (cov4) in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 5 Name: EVI/Annual_EVI_resampled_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 5 Description: Enhanced vegetation index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 6 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/Sites_8Feb2011.csv * File 6 Description: List of checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * CommunityName: name of communities * LatDecDeg: latitude in geographical coordinates * LongDecDeg: longitude in geographical coordinates * Country: country * MinElevation_m: minimum elevation from sea level in meters * MaxElevation_m: maximum elevation from sea level in meters * AreaSampled: sampled area in square meters * AllSpp: number of species recorded * SppWithPhy: number of species recorded with phylogenetic information * SppWithMorph: number of species recorded with morphological information * File 7 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/SpeciesxSite8Feb2011.csv * File 7 Description: List of species sightings in the checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * Spname: Species name * CommunityName: name of communities * Country: country * SpID: identifying number of species * Folder 8 Name: PO_observations_non_thinned/ * Folder 8 Description: Folder contains species point records as species-specific CSV files. * Columns: * lat: latitude in geographical coordinates * lon: longitude in geographical coordinates * Folder 9 Name: Study_area/ * Folder 9 Description: Folder contains study area (rectangle with the extent matching the extent of the union of all species domains) in geographical (WGS 84) and planar (laea) coordinate system. * File 10 Name: TRI/tri_1KMmd_GMTEDmd_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 10 Description: Topographical ruggedness index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * Folder 11 Name: Compiled_data_v9/ * Folder 11 Description: Folder contains two .RData-files for two example species, Coeligena lutitae (Buff-winged starfrontlet) and Ensifera ensifera (Sword-billed hummingbird).

<p>Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) that integrate presence-only and presence-absence data offer a promising avenue to improve information on species’ geographic distributions. The use of such ‘integrated SDMs’ on a species range-wide extent has been constrained by the often-limited presence-absence data and by the heterogeneous sampling of the presence-only data. Here, we evaluate integrated SDMs for studying species ranges with a novel expert range map-based evaluation. We build a new understanding about how integrated SDMs address issues of estimation accuracy and data deficiency and thereby offer advantages over traditional SDMs. Location South and Central America. Time period 1979-2017. Major taxa studied Hummingbirds. Methods We build integrated SDMs by linking two observation models – one for each data type – to the same underlying spatial process. We validate SDMs with two schemes: i) cross-validation with presence-absence data and ii) comparison with respect to the species’ whole range as defined with IUCN range maps. We also compare models relative to the estimated response curves and compute the association between the benefit of the data integration and the number of presence records in each data set. Results The integrated SDM accounting for the spatially varying sampling intensity of the presence-only data was one of the top-performing models in both model validation schemes. Presence-only data alleviated overly large niche estimates, and data integration was beneficial compared to modelling solely presence-only data for species that had few presence points when predicting the species’ whole range. On the community level, integrated models improved the species richness prediction. Main conclusions Integrated SDMs combining presence-only and presence-absence data are successfully able to borrow strengths from both data types and offer improved predictions of species’ ranges. Integrated SDMs can potentially alleviate the impacts of taxonomically and geographically uneven sampling and to leverage the detailed sampling information in presence-absence data.</p>

<p>This data set is a collection of publicly available species and environmental data. They have been used to study populations and distributions of species and their associations with environment. To avoid risks on species populations, coordinates of the presence records for three species with near-threatened IUCN status and all checklist coordinates have been rounded to 0.01 degrees. The species are Little Woodstar (Chaetocercus bombus), Black-thighed Puffleg (Eriocnemis derbyi) and Hoary Puffleg (Haplophaedia lugens). ## Description of the data and file structure * File 1 Name: Cloud_cover/MODCF_intraannualSD_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 1 Description: Intra-annual variability of cloud cover in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * Folder 2 Name: Domains_new/ * Folder 2 Description: Folder contains geotif-file for each species showing the study domain, which is a buffer around species expert range map and points records. * File 3 Name: Elevation_range/topography_elevation_1KMmi_GMTEDmi_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 3 Description: Areal elevation from sea level in meters in 1 square kilometer resolution over the study area. * File 4 Name: Environment/Chelsa_SA.tif * File 4 Description: Chelsa Bioclim (v. 1.2) of annual mean temperature (cov1), mean annual diurnal range (cov2), mean annual precipitation sum (cov3) and precipitation seasonality (cov4) in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 5 Name: EVI/Annual_EVI_resampled_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 5 Description: Enhanced vegetation index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * File 6 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/Sites_8Feb2011.csv * File 6 Description: List of checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * CommunityName: name of communities * LatDecDeg: latitude in geographical coordinates * LongDecDeg: longitude in geographical coordinates * Country: country * MinElevation_m: minimum elevation from sea level in meters * MaxElevation_m: maximum elevation from sea level in meters * AreaSampled: sampled area in square meters * AllSpp: number of species recorded * SppWithPhy: number of species recorded with phylogenetic information * SppWithMorph: number of species recorded with morphological information * File 7 Name: PA_observations/Juan_parra_checklists/SpeciesxSite8Feb2011.csv * File 7 Description: List of species sightings in the checklist locations. * Columns: * Communities_IDComm: identifying number of communities * Spname: Species name * CommunityName: name of communities * Country: country * SpID: identifying number of species * Folder 8 Name: PO_observations_non_thinned/ * Folder 8 Description: Folder contains species point records as species-specific CSV files. * Columns: * lat: latitude in geographical coordinates * lon: longitude in geographical coordinates * Folder 9 Name: Study_area/ * Folder 9 Description: Folder contains study area (rectangle with the extent matching the extent of the union of all species domains) in geographical (WGS 84) and planar (laea) coordinate system. * File 10 Name: TRI/tri_1KMmd_GMTEDmd_resampled_masked_NA30x30_americas.tif * File 10 Description: Topographical ruggedness index in 1 square kilometer resolution. * Folder 11 Name: Compiled_data_v9/ * Folder 11 Description: Folder contains two .RData-files for two example species, Coeligena lutitae (Buff-winged starfrontlet) and Ensifera ensifera (Sword-billed hummingbird).
