This sampling activity is expected to occur once at each NEON terrestrial site. Root material is sorted, dried, weighed, and analyzed, then any excess root sample material is archived in the NEON Biorepository and are available on request. For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section below.

A summary table of external lab precision and accuracy is included in the expanded package.\nLatency: Data were collected once, at the establishment of each site. Data were published within one year of collection, and future collections at existing sites are not expected.\nMethods Each site is sampled a single time. At each site, a soil Megapit is dug in the dominant soil type to a maximum depth of 2 m. On the exposed face of the soil pit, a tape measure visually divides the soil profile into 10 cm depth increments. Each soil pit has three vertically-oriented sampling profiles, roughly corresponding to the left, center, and right of the pit sampling face. These profiles are referred to as profile number 1, 2 and 3, respectively. From each profile, a block of soil is removed from each 10 cm depth increment, starting from the surface down to 100 cm. Once a depth of 100 cm is reached, the each profile is divided into 20 cm depth increments. By the end of sampling, up to 45 soil samples are collected, 15 per profile. Roots are sieved and then divided into four categories distinguishing between status (alive or dead) and size (\u003e 2mm and \u003c 2 mm, unless otherwise noted). Once roots are weighed and dried, they are sent to an external laboratory for analysis of carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotopes. Any remaining root material is held in the NEON Biorepository and available upon request.\nAccess Points https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10066.001/RELEASE-2022\n",
