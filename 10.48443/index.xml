      <description>Abstract This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON&amp;rsquo;s belowground plant biomass stock and chemistry measurements from Megapits. Soil samples were collected at 10 cm depth increments to the first 100 cm below the surface, then 20 cm depth increments thereafter, along three vertical profiles from a single temporary soil pit at a location expected to be representative of NEON sensor-based soil plots. This sampling activity is expected to occur once at each NEON terrestrial site.</description>

      <description>Abstract Soil properties affect the movement of water, heat and gases into and out of the soil. They also influence the availability of nutrients to plants and soil organisms and the production and stabilization of soil organic matter. Soil physical and chemical properties are measured by horizon from a single temporary soil &amp;ldquo;Megapit&amp;rdquo; at each terrestrial site at depths of up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites).</description>

      <description>Abstract Soil volumetric water content and an index of soil water ion content (salinity) are measured at various depths below the soil surface from approximately 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle and is the dominant source of water for most plants and soil organisms making it a key indicator of drought.</description>
