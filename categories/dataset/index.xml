      <description>Abstract Advances in spring migratory phenology comprise some of the most well-documented evidence for the impacts of climate change on birds. Nevertheless, surprisingly little research has investigated whether birds are shifting their migratory phenology equally across sex and age classes – a question critical to understanding the potential for trophic mismatch. We used 60-years of bird banding data across North America – comprising over 4 million captures in total – to investigate both spring and fall migratory phenology for a total of 98 bird species across sex and age classes, with the exact numbers of species for each analysis depending on season-specific data availability.</description>

      <description>Abstract Alkaloids are important bioactive molecules throughout the natural world, and in many animals, they serve as a source of chemical defense against predation. Dendrobatid poison frogs bioaccumulate alkaloids from their diet to make themselves toxic or unpalatable to predators. Despite the proposed roles of plasma proteins as mediators of alkaloid trafficking and bioavailability, the responsible proteins have not been identified. We use chemical approaches to show that a ~50 kDa plasma protein is the principal alkaloid binding molecule in blood from poison frogs.</description>

      <description>Abstract The 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado Island was initially demarcated and fully censused in 1982, and has been fully censused 7 times since, every 5 years from 1985 through 2015 (Hubbell and Foster 1983, Hubbell et al. 1990, Condit et al. 2012, Condit et al. 2017). Every measurement of every stem over 8 censuses is included in this archive. Most users will need only the 8 R Analytical Tables in the format tree, which come here zipped together into a single archive (bci.</description>

      <description>Abstract Plasticity is a widespread feature of development, enabling phenotypic change based on the environment. Although the evolutionary loss of plasticity has been linked both theoretically and empirically to increased rates of phenotypic diversification, molecular insights into how this process might unfold are generally lacking. Here, we show that a regulator of nongenetic inheritance links evolutionary loss of plasticity in nature to changes in plasticity and morphology as selected in the laboratory.</description>

      <description>Abstract This dataset presents comprehensive information on the development and characterization of antibacterial polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings incorporating tanfloc, a plant-derived condensed tannin polymer with inherent antimicrobial properties. The dataset encompasses experimental data related to the fabrication of PEMs using tanfloc as either a polyanion or a polycation, expanding the versatility of this amphoteric polymer in PEM coatings. Typically, PEMs are formed by combining a polycation and a polyanion with complementary ionic groups.</description>

      <description>Abstract The decision to stop growing and mature into an adult is a critical point in development that determines adult body size, impacting multiple aspects of an adult’s biology. In many animals, growth-cessation is a consequence of hormone release that appears to be tied to attainment of particular body size or condition. Nevertheless, the size-sensing mechanism animals use to initiate hormone synthesis is poorly understood. Here we develop a simple mathematical model of growth cessation in Drosophila melanogaster, which is ostensibly triggered by attainment of a critical weight early in the last instar.</description>

      <description>Abstract Accurate interpretation of the genetic signatures of past demographic events is crucial for reconstructing evolutionary history. Lineage fusion (complete merging, resulting in a single panmictic population) is a special case of secondary contact that is seldom considered. Here, the circumstances under which lineage fusion can be distinguished from population size constancy, growth, bottleneck, and decline were investigated. Multi-locus haplotype data were simulated under models of lineage fusion with different divergence versus sampling lag times (D:L ratios).</description>

      <description>Abstract Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) that integrate presence-only and presence-absence data offer a promising avenue to improve information on species’ geographic distributions. The use of such ‘integrated SDMs’ on a species range-wide extent has been constrained by the often-limited presence-absence data and by the heterogeneous sampling of the presence-only data. Here, we evaluate integrated SDMs for studying species ranges with a novel expert range map-based evaluation. We build a new understanding about how integrated SDMs address issues of estimation accuracy and data deficiency and thereby offer advantages over traditional SDMs.</description>

      <description>Abstract Co-assembling peptides can be crafted into supramolecular biomaterials for use in biotechnological applications, such as cell culture scaffolds, drug delivery, biosensors, and tissue engineering. Peptide co-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of two different peptides into a supramolecular architecture. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the effect of anionic amino acid type on co-assembly dynamics and nanofiber structure in binary CATCH(+/-) peptide systems. CATCH peptide sequences follow a general pattern: CQCFCFCFCQC, where all C’s are either a positively charged or a negatively charged amino acid.</description>

      <description>Abstract Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated. We analyzed phosphorus (P) inputs (fertilization and atmospheric deposition) and outputs (harvest and leaching losses) over seven years in three representative biomass crops—switchgrass (Panicum virga­tum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) and hybrid poplar trees (Populus nigra X P. maximowiczii) – as well as in no-till corn (maize; Zea mays L.</description>

      <description>Abstract An underexplored question in evolutionary genetics concerns the extent to which mutational bias in the production of genetic variation influences outcomes and pathways of adaptive molecular evolution. In the genomes of at least some vertebrate taxa, an important form of mutation bias involves changes at CpG dinucleotides: If the DNA nucleotide cytosine (C) is immediately 5’ to guanine (G) on the same coding strand, and if the C is methylated, then C→T and G→A mutations occur at an elevated rate relative to mutations at non-CpG sites.</description>

      <description>Abstract Wildlife microbiome studies are being used to assess microbial links with animal health and habitat. The gold standard of sampling microbiomes directly from captured animals is ideal for limiting potential abiotic influences on microbiome composition, yet fails to leverage the many benefits of non-invasive sampling. Application of microbiome-based monitoring for rare, endangered, or elusive species creates a need to non-invasively collect scat samples shed into the environment. Since controlling sample age is not always possible, the potential influence of time-associated abiotic factors was assessed.</description>

      <description>Abstract Plant populations are limited by resource availability and exhibit physiological trade-offs in resource acquisition strategies. These trade-offs may constrain the ability of populations to exhibit fast growth rates under water limitation and high cover of neighbors. However, traits that confer drought tolerance may also confer resistance to competition. It remains unclear how fitness responses to these abiotic conditions and biotic interactions combine to structure grassland communities and how this relationship may change along a gradient of water availability.</description>

      <description>Abstract The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorizes states to create early intervention (EI) programming to provide developmental and therapeutic services to infants and toddlers with a developmental condition; EI programs are mandated to report on child and family outcomes for purposes of accountability and quality improvement. For both purposes, there is critical need for research evidence on the adequacy of EI services. The researchers for this study partnered with a large urban EI program in Colorado that had recently transitioned to electronic data capture and was implementing a statewide initiative to facilitate function-focused care with individual families and paired collected electronic patient-reported outcomes (e-PRO) data with EI administrative data on child and family characteristics and service use to more fully examine EI service adequacy relative to patient-important outcomes.</description>

      <description>Abstract Technological advances continue to push the boundaries of scientific inquiry in animal behavior. One such development is the emergence of automated tracking systems, which enable the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal information for animals. Although tag-based tracking systems provide valuable insights into animal movement and collective behavior, the attachment of devices can have detrimental effects in some cases. Here, we investigated the effects of recently developed miniature tracking tags using the rock ant, Temnothorax rugatulus, as a model system.</description>

The NGR system uses layers of passive shielding (lead) and active shielding (plastic scintillators and coincidence electronics) to reduce the cosmic-ray signal for low-count analysis of sediment core sections and to obtain the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Data are reported on a total counts per second basis and the raw spectral files are available as compressed files for later analysis.</description>

      <description>Abstract Operational rig information data were measured using a variety of sensors and compiled using the RigWatch software package. Approximately 50 channels of drilling/coring data are captured in real time during the expedition. Data are presented as ASCII files extracted from the proprietary RigWatch data files and are presented by expedition. RigWatch data in time or depth domain can be imported into graphics and analysis programs to be merged and correlated with core physical properties data to enhance assessment of poor core recovery intervals.</description>

      <description>Abstract Digital section images were taken of the flat face of split cores on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) using a linescan camera at a resolution of 20 lines/mm (50 micron pixels). Cores were imaged as soon as possible after splitting to minimize color changes that occur through oxidation and drying. The SHIL produces TIF files as well as reduced-size JPG files. The TIF files are not kept online but users may request them from the IODP-JRSO Data Librarian.</description>

      <description>Abstract IPUMS USA contains harmonized census and American Community Survey (ACS) data from 1790 to the present. For the period 1850 to 1940, IPUMS includes 100% of individuals in the decennial censuses. For the period 1950 to 2010, we have public use samples of decennial censuses. For the period since 2000, IPUMS provides annual ACS public use samples. The available information in the censuses and ACS varies by year, but generally includes basic housing data (type of housing, household appliances, and housing characteristics), demographic data (age, race, sex, marital status, and relationship to the head of household), economic data (occupation, industry, income, work status), and other individual characteristics (migration, disability, veteran status).</description>

      <description>Abstract This dataset contains data from 645,337 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped on GenoChip 2+ microarrays. The SNP data were ascertained from the mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomes for each individual, depending on their biological sex. In total, 5,205 mtDNA and 10,272 Y-chromosome SNPs were extracted from the array data. These data files have been uploaded as .csv files and also be uploaded as plink-formatted files. Details about the analysis of the SNP data can be found in the associated manuscript: Theodore G Schurr, Ramaz Shengelia, Michel Shamoon-Pour, David Chitanava, Shorena Laliashvili, Irma Laliashvili, Redate Kibret, Yanu Kume-Kangkolo, Irakli Akhvlediani, Lia Bitadze, Iain Mathieson, Aram Yardumian, Genetic Analysis of Mingrelians Reveals Long-Term Continuity of Populations in Western Georgia (Caucasus), Genome Biology and Evolution, 2023; evad198, https://doi.</description>

      <description>Abstract The ability to estimate 3D human body pose and movement, also known as human pose estimation~(HPE), enables many applications for home-based health monitoring, such as remote rehabilitation training. Several possible solutions have emerged using sensors ranging from RGB cameras, depth sensors, millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radars, and wearable inertial sensors. Despite previous efforts on datasets and benchmarks for HPE, few datasets exploit multiple modalities and focus on home-based health monitoring. To bridge this gap, we present mRI, a multi-modal 3D human pose estimation dataset with mmWave, RGB-D, and Inertial Sensors.</description>

      <description>Abstract A continuous ice core analytical system was used to analyze the ~410 m NEEM-2011-S1 ice core collected in summer 2011 near the NEEM deep drilling site in NW Greenland. The core was analyzed for a broad range of elements and chemical species using a coupled continuous flow analysis system with two inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers and single-particle soot photometer. The aerosol records are provided at 2 cm depth resolution to account for signal dispersion in the online analytical system.</description>

      <description>Abstract We report on the direct observation of resonant electric dipole-dipole interactions in a cubic array of atoms in the many-excitation limit. The interactions, mediated by single-atom couplings to the shared electromagnetic vacuum, are shown to produce spatially-dependent cooperative Lamb shifts when spectroscopically interrogating the mHz-wide optical clock transition in strontium-87. We show that the ensemble-averaged shifts can be suppressed below the level of evaluated systematic uncertainties for state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks.</description>

      <description>Abstract We investigate the possibility to use polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in stalagmites as proxies for paleofires at KNI-51, a shallow cave located in tropical Western Australia, where bushfire is a regular occurrence. In order to test links between the stalagmite PAHs and fire above the cave, we performed a series of experiments using PAH distributions in stalagmite aragonite, sediment from the cave and overlying soil. In addition, the possibility of surface contamination was evaluated by measuring PAH abundances and distributions in sequential digestions.</description>

      <description>Abstract Motivation: Phylogenomics faces a dilemma: on the one hand, the most accurate species and gene tree estimation methods are those that co-estimate them; on the other hand, these co-estimation methods do not scale to moderately large numbers of species. The summary-based methods, which first infer gene trees independently and then combine them, are much more scalable but are prone to gene tree estimation error, which is inevitable when inferring trees from limited-length data.</description>

      <description>Abstract This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON&amp;rsquo;s belowground plant biomass stock and chemistry measurements from Megapits. Soil samples were collected at 10 cm depth increments to the first 100 cm below the surface, then 20 cm depth increments thereafter, along three vertical profiles from a single temporary soil pit at a location expected to be representative of NEON sensor-based soil plots. This sampling activity is expected to occur once at each NEON terrestrial site.</description>

      <description>Abstract Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that temperate herbivores surf the green wave of emerging plants during spring migration. Despite the importance of autumn migration, few studies have conceptualized resource tracking of temperate herbivores during this critical season. We adapted the Frost Wave Hypothesis (FWH), which posits that animals pace their autumn migration to reduce exposure to snow but increase acquisition of forage. We tested the FWH in a population of mule deer in Wyoming, USA by tracking the autumn migrations of n = 163 mule deer that moved 15–288 km from summer to winter range.</description>

      <description>Abstract Soil properties affect the movement of water, heat and gases into and out of the soil. They also influence the availability of nutrients to plants and soil organisms and the production and stabilization of soil organic matter. Soil physical and chemical properties are measured by horizon from a single temporary soil &amp;ldquo;Megapit&amp;rdquo; at each terrestrial site at depths of up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites).</description>

      <description>Abstract Soil volumetric water content and an index of soil water ion content (salinity) are measured at various depths below the soil surface from approximately 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle and is the dominant source of water for most plants and soil organisms making it a key indicator of drought.</description>

      <description>Abstract We use these data to test whether temperature can indirectly affect the fitness of Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba by altering interspecific competitive outcomes. We show that, when raised in isolation, both D. santomea and D. yakuba display similar variation in relative fitness across temperatures of 18°C, 22°C, and 25°C. However, D. santomea has higher fitness than D. yakuba when experiencing interspecific competition at 18°C, while the inverse is true at 25°C.</description>

      <description>Abstract Some animals mimic behaviors or signals of conspecifics while courting. Sexual mimicry is beneficial when it increases reproductive success. We explored the function of a novel form of sexual mimicry in the courtship display of male Enchenopa treehoppers. Males produce plant-borne vibrational advertisement signals, to which females respond. Interestingly, males also produce a female mimic signal, and we experimentally tested its function. First, with a female priming hypothesis, we tested if this signal would increase female response.</description>

      <description>Abstract Extreme weather events perturb ecosystems and increasingly threaten biodiversity1. Ecologists emphasize the need to forecast and mitigate the impacts of these incidents, which requires knowledge of how risk is distributed among species and environments, but the scale and unpredictability of extreme events complicates assessment1–4. These challenges are compounded for large animals (‘megafauna’), which play crucial ecological roles but are hard to study5. Traits such as body size, dispersal ability, and habitat affiliation are among the hypothesized determinants of animals’ vulnerability to natural hazards1,6,7.</description>
