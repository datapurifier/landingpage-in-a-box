      <description>Abstract Manufacturing continues to be a vital component of the Ohio economy. Ohio&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing sector employs over 600,000 skilled individuals, the third-largest manufacturing workforce in the U.S. [1]. With additional manufacturing industries moving into Ohio, including Intel and its supply chain partners, there is a growing need for industry-ready, skilled engineering technicians. In addition, with the increasing use of automated systems and network connectivity of these systems in manufacturing operations, technicians need to be equipped with skills in the area of smart manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Secondary Orbital Interactions Enhance the Reactivity of Alkynes in Diels-Alder Cycloadditions</title>

      <description>Abstract We have investigated the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions of trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and endo-bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) with a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine, a cyclopentadienone, and an ortho-benzoquinone. Tetrazines react significantly faster with TCO compared to BCN because the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of TCO is significantly higher in energy than the HOMO of BCN and there is less distortion of the tetrazine. Despite the different HOMO energies, TCO and BCN have similar reactivities toward cyclopentadienones, while BCN is significantly more reactive than TCO in the cycloaddition with ortho-benzoquinone.</description>
