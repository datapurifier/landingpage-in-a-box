# Abstract
Phenotypic data related to water use efficiency (WUE) in sagebrush seedlings; specifically, stomata density and size on both leaf surfaces and the anatomy of vessels (i.e., xylem). Natural abundance stable carbon isotope data was also collected to confirm similar physiological processes between individuals analyzed within the study.
