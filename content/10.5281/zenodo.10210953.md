# Abstract
Operational rig information data were measured using a variety of sensors and compiled using the RigWatch software package. Approximately 50 channels of drilling/coring data are captured in real time during the expedition. Data are presented as ASCII files extracted from the proprietary RigWatch data files and are presented by expedition. RigWatch data in time or depth domain can be imported into graphics and analysis programs to be merged and correlated with core physical properties data to enhance assessment of poor core recovery intervals.
