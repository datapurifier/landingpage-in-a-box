# Abstract
This dataset contains data from 645,337 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped on GenoChip 2+ microarrays. The SNP data were ascertained from the mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomes for each individual, depending on their biological sex. In total, 5,205 mtDNA and 10,272 Y-chromosome SNPs were extracted from the array data. These data files have been uploaded as .csv files and also be uploaded as plink-formatted files. Details about the analysis of the SNP data can be found in the associated manuscript:
