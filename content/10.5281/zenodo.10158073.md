# Abstract
Manufacturing continues to be a vital component of the Ohio economy. Ohio's manufacturing sector employs over 600,000 skilled individuals, the third-largest manufacturing workforce in the U.S. [1]. With additional manufacturing industries moving into Ohio, including Intel and its supply chain partners, there is a growing need for industry-ready, skilled engineering technicians. In addition, with the increasing use of automated systems and network connectivity of these systems in manufacturing operations, technicians need to be equipped with skills in the area of smart manufacturing. This article details the development of a Smart Manufacturing Technology (SMT) associate's degree that is modeled as an earn-and-learn program. The program is equipped with various experiential learning opportunities, and additional industry-recognized certifications are embedded within specific courses. Summer camps were designed and delivered to expose middle and high school students to smart manufacturing and to build a pipeline of students into this program. A professional development summit was delivered each year of the grant. The purpose of the summit was to increase high school instructors' awareness of smart manufacturing so that they can better advise students about this in-demand field and teach courses in the SMT pathway.
