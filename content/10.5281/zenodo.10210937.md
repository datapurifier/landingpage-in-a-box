# Abstract
Moisture and density (MAD) data were acquired on ~10 mL sediment or rock samples by measuring three out of four material parameters: wet (saturated) mass, wet volume, dry mass, and/or dry volume after 24 h drying in a convection oven at 105 degrees C. From the moisture and volume measurements, the following phase relationships are calculated: wet and dry water content, wet bulk density, dry bulk density, grain density, porosity, and void ratio. The combination of measurements is defined by the submethod chosen: A, B, C, or D. Wet (A, B, or C) and dry (A, B, C, or D) mass is determined using motion-compensated balances.  Wet volume is determined either by helium pycnometry (A) or by the sample's geometric dimensions using calipers (A or D).  Dry volume (C or D) is measured by helium pycnometry.  Submethods A and B are not recommended by IODP.  Submethod C is suitable for saturated materials such as fine-grained sediments.  Submethod D is suitable for unsaturated porous material such as certain limestones and basalts.
