# Abstract
IPUMS USA contains harmonized census and American Community Survey (ACS) data from 1790 to the present. For the period 1850 to 1940, IPUMS includes 100% of individuals in the decennial censuses. For the period 1950 to 2010, we have public use samples of decennial censuses. For the period since 2000, IPUMS provides annual ACS public use samples. The available information in the censuses and ACS varies by year, but generally includes basic housing data (type of housing, household appliances, and housing characteristics), demographic data (age, race, sex, marital status, and relationship to the head of household), economic data (occupation, industry, income, work status), and other individual characteristics (migration, disability, veteran status). For the period 1790 to 1840, IPUMS includes household level records for 100% of households. IPUMS USA is available through an online data access system free of charge to registered users at usa.ipums.org.
