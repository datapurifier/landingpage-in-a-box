# Abstract
This respository contains multiple datasets collected during a 20 year investigation of the responses of willow (Salix spp.) communities in Yellowstone National Park after the restoration of large carnivores. The study sought to understand whether the restoration of wolves to the food web cause a change in the state of willow communities that occured while wolves were absent. Each dataset has a corresonding file of metadata.

## Methods
Sampling and experimental designs and methods used to collect the data were described in Hobbs, N. T., D. B. Johnston, K. N. Marshall, E.C. Wolf, and D. J. Cooper. Does restoring apex predators to food webs restoreecosystems? Large carnivores in Yellowstone as a model system. Ecological Monographs. In press.

## Other
The data could be process further with almost any program, but we used R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) (R Core Team, 2022. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. R Foundation forStatistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the following packages: [1] "cowplot" "gridExtra" "bayesplot" "HDInterval" [5] "MCMCvis" "rjags" "doParallel" "iterators" [9] "foreach" "dclone" "Matrix" "parallel" [13] "coda" "forcats" "stringr" "dplyr" [17] "purrr" "readr" "tidyr" "tibble" [21] "ggplot2" "tidyverse" "stats" "graphics" [25] "grDevices" "utils" "datasets" "methods" [29] "base" All of these programs are open-source
