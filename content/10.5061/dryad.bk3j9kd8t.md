# Abstract
We use these data to test whether temperature can indirectly affect the fitness of Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba by altering interspecific competitive outcomes. We show that, when raised in isolation, both D. santomea and D. yakuba display similar variation in relative fitness across temperatures of 18°C, 22°C, and 25°C. However, D. santomea has higher fitness than D. yakuba when experiencing interspecific competition at 18°C, while the inverse is true at 25°C. Patterns of fitness across thermal and competitive environments therefore indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition varies with temperature. We then use a ‘coexistence’ experiment to show that D. santomea is rapidly (within 8 generations) extirpated when maintained with D. yakuba at 25°C. By contrast, D. santomea remains as (or more) abundant than D. yakuba over the course of ~10 generations when maintained at 18°C. Results provide an example of how the thermal environment can affect interspecific competition and suggest that some species may become more prone to extinction under scenarios of climate change through indirect effects of the thermal environment on competitive advantages between species.

## Methods
Raw count data were collected in the lab. Climate data were downloaded (bioclim variables) or recorded using Senonics Minnow 1.0TH data loggers. All data given are raw data. Associated scripts used to process and analyze those data are also provided.
