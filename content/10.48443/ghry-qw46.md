# Abstract
Soil volumetric water content and an index of soil water ion content (salinity) are measured at various depths below the soil surface from approximately 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle and is the dominant source of water for most plants and soil organisms making it a key indicator of drought. In addition, soil moisture status influences the severity of flooding and temperature extremes, as well as physical, chemical and biological processes in the soil. Measurements are made in vertical profiles consisting of up to eight depths in all five instrumented soil plots at each terrestrial site, and presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

## Methods
When possible the soil plots were arranged in a transect with the first plot approximately 15-40 m from the tower in the expected dominant airshed. The middle of airshed was used as the transect vector and plot spacing was based on the distance required for surface soil temperature and moisture measurements to be spatially independent at the 1 hectare scale during site characterization (capped at approximately 40 m due to logistical constraints). Soil plots were microsited as necessary to avoid obstacles (e.g., boulders, streams, and paths) and more compact plot layouts were used at small sites. Soil moisture and salinity index are measured at up to eight depths within each plot, with the mid-point of the shallowest sensors at approximately 6, 16, and 26 cm. Depths for deeper sensors vary among sites and are based on megapit soil horizon data (NEON.DP1.00097) and depth to restrictive feature (see NEON.DOC.003146).
