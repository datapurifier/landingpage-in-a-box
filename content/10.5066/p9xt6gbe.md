# Abstract
Honey bees (Apis mellifera), a critical agricultural pollinator in many areas, have a high rate of infection with a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV), yet little is known about its ecology or impact on honey bee colonies, other than its ubiquity and apparent low virulence. This study scanned over 5,000 public data sets to detect AmFV sequences in honey bees as well as a parasitic mite of honey bees, Varroa destructor, that is a potential vector of AmFV. The data release consists of these files: 1. AmFV.genome.assemblies.aligned.fas, which contains new AmFV draft genome sequences generated by this study aligned with existing reference genome accessions downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 2. kmer.list.txt, a list of kmers that were extracted from reference sequences and searched for in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accessions. 3. sample.metadata.txt, which lists all accessions of the SRA, and NCBI database of high-throughput sequence data, that were used in this study. The file also includes the raw occurrence counts of kmers listed in kmer.lists.txt, summed by category.
