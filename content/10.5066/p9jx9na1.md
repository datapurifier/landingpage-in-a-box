# Abstract
This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Data Release provides water-quality data collected during 1-week and 2-week nutrient studies beginning on February 22, May 17, and July 26 located in the Caloosahatchee River at the S-79 water-control structure. For each study period, 12 fiberglass tanks were suspended in the river using three floating cradles with each cradle holding four tanks. Each tank was open to the atmosphere and closed to the river. The tanks were filled with native water during the first day of each study period. Four different treatment methods were represented within each cradle. For all three study periods, three of the four treatments remained constant: ammonium hydroxide, sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate, and untreated. For the 1-week study period in February, the fourth treatment method was sodium nitrate. For the 2-week study periods in May and July, urea replaced sodium nitrate for analysis. Treatments were added to the tanks following the profiles on the first day of each study period. Nutrient samples were collected and processed by Nova Southeastern University. Water-quality sensor data were collected near the surface (approximately 1 foot below the water surface), near the middle of the water column (approximately 2 feet below the water surface), and near the bottom (approximately 3 feet below the water surface) of each tank using a multi-parameter water-quality sonde. Additional water-quality sensor data were collected at approximately 1, 2, and 3 feet below the water surface within the river. Each point reading is provided as an instantaneous measurement. Water-quality parameters measured include water temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, phycocyanin fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence, and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter.
