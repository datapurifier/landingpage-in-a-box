# Abstract
REDPy (Repeating Earthquake Detector in Python) is a tool for automated detection and analysis of repeating earthquakes in continuous data. It works without any previous assumptions of what repeating seismicity looks like (that is, does not require a template event). Repeating earthquakes are clustered into families based on waveform similarity via cross-correlation across multiple stations. All data, including waveforms, are stored in a HDF5 database using PyTables.
