# Abstract
Mineral abundances within bulk and size-fractionated mine waste from sampled historical waste piles from the Tar Creek Superfund Site, Oklahoma, U.S.A., were determined by Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Data and methods reported are part of a research study published below in the 'Related External Resources' section.
