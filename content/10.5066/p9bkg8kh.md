# Abstract
We conducted a serosurvey of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) for vector-borne pathogens in 2016-2017 that were captured in the Hiawatha National Forest in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. At capture, in addition to age, sex, body weight of the hare and a blood sample data was collected on the ecological land type (USDA Forest Service. 2006. Hiawatha National Forest 2006 Forest Plan. https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/hiawatha/landmanagement/planning/?cid=STELPRDB5106336) at the point of capture. Serology was conducted for antibodies to Snowshoe hare virus, Jamestown Canyon virus, La Crosse virus, West Nile virus, tick-transmitted Powassan virus, Silverwater virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Francisella tularensis.
