# Abstract
This dataset is a collection of geochemical data on samples from the Stibnite-Yellow Pine district of Idaho. The datasets include: whole rock geochemistry; lead, strontium and neodymium isotope chemistry of sulfides and whole rock samples by isotope dilution-thermal-mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS); in situ sulfur isotope chemistry of sulfides by laser ablation-multi collector-inductively coupled-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS); electron microprobe (EMP) images, cathodoluminescence (CL) images and spectra, along with EMP and laser ablation-inductively coupled-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) trace element analysis of sulfides and quartz; and fluid inclusion microthermometry and raman. Samples were collected from the surface and from a series of drill holes transecting the Yellow Pine, Hangar Flats, and West End deposits within the district. Sample were submitted for USGS contract laboratory analysis and processed for ID-TIMS isotopic analysis. High-contrast backscattered electron (BSE) scanning electron microscope SEM imaging were collected to determine zonation, followed by of EMP analysis, followed by a selection of LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. After determining mineral and fluid inclusion paragenesis by studying optical petrography and SEM imagery, fluid inclusion microthermometric data and raman spectra were collected.
