# Abstract
As part of the Coastal Sediment Availability and Flux and Defense Advanced Research Protection Agency (DARPA) Reefense projects, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center (SPCMSC) conducted a nearshore geophysical survey to map the shoreface and inner shelf, as well as characterizing stratigraphy near Boca Chica Key, Florida (FL) in November 2022. The purpose of this study was to conduct a geologic assessment (including bathymetric mapping) of the nearshore ledge off Boca Chica Key, FL, in support of efforts to construct an artificial coral reef offshore of Naval Air Station Key West. Collecting geophysical data can help researchers to identify relationships between the geologic history of the island, its present-day morphology, and sediment distribution. This data release serves as an archive of subbottom profile and navigation data collected November 8-13, 2022, offshore of Boca Chica Key, FL, during USGS Field Activity Number 2022-334-FA. Data products, including chirp subbottom profile data and images, survey trackline maps, location data with formal Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata, and field logs are provided. Coastal bathymetry and imagery data were also collected during this geophysical survey and are provided in another data release (Stalk and others, 2023).
