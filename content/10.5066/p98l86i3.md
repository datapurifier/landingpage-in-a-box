# Abstract
This dataset contains all the layers associated with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) initiative for the Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA) which aims to identify and rank coastal areas with the greatest potential for wetland habitat restoration. Each layer has a unique contribution to the identification of restorable wetlands. The 7 parameters (Parameter 0: Mask, Parameter 1: Hydroperiod, Parameter 2: Wetland Soils, Parameter 3: Flowlines, Parameter 4: Conservation and Recreation Lands, Parameter 5: Impervious Surfaces, and Parameter 6: Land Use) and Index Composite directly correlate to areas that are recommended for restoration. The dikes, degree flowlines, culverts, study area and DEM datasets are supplemental layers that provide additional information around the priority rank values. All layers were produced in collaboration with the USGS Upper Midwest Water Science Center, USGS Great Lakes Science Center, and by the New College of Florida. For more information on the methodology used to create these parameters, view the metadata from GLCWRA: Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA) and the GLCWRA webpage: https://glcwra.wim.usgs.gov/.
