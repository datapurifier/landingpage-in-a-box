# Abstract
We measured Survival endpoints for juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in response to exposure to wildland fire retardants. Exposures were less than 24 hours. We documented time to mortality hourly through 12 hours of exposure and again at 24 hours. This data set includes data for three current use fire retardants from the US Forest Service Qualified Products List (Phos-Chek 259-Fx, Phos-Chek MVP-Fx, and Phos-Chek LC-95A-R). Also included are water quality data measured in each treatment at the beginning of each assay and quality assurance/ quality control data which validates the accuracy of those water quality measurements.
