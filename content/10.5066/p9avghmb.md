# Abstract
This data release includes data created, collected, and/or otherwise modified in the process of quantifying a sediment budget for the Smith Creek Watershed near New Market, Virginia, USA. Five raster files are included, namely a modeled index of hydrological connectivity, a raster model of modeled floodplain depositional masses and extent, a rasters of modeled gross and delivered upland erosion, and a hydrologically conditioned Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Two vector shapefiles are also included. The first documents the results from the stepwise linear regression models developed to estimate erosion attributed to streambeds, streambanks, and floodplains along stream reaches throughout the watershed. The second documents the same results, now converted to mass rates, for streambeds and streambanks at the sub-watershed level. Floodplain mass results are included in the raster documenting depositional masses and modeled floodplain extent. The Finally, five comma delimited tables are included: three contain field-measured rates of erosion and deposition for streambeds, streambanks, and floodplains for a number of sites throughout the watershed, as well as the independent variables used for model development; a fourth table contains information pertaining to density of source samples collected in the field for the various source types; the final table contains data concerning suspended sediment loads measured at the watershed outlet, in addition to flow type classifications.
