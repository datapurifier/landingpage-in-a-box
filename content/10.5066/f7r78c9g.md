# Abstract
The Groundwater Toolbox is a graphical and mapping interface for analysis of hydrologic data. The software is a customized interface built on the non-proprietary, open-source MapWindow geographic information system software in a Microsoft Windows computing environment. The Groundwater Toolbox allows for the retrieval of hydrologic time-series data (streamflow, groundwater levels, and precipitation) from the USGS National Water Information System; preprocessed meteorological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Climatic Data Center also are available with the Groundwater Toolbox. The Groundwater Toolbox has several methods for the analysis of streamflow-hydrograph data. These methods include six hydrograph-separation techniques � the Base-Flow Index (BFI Standard and Modified), HYSEP (Fixed Interval, Sliding Interval, and Local Minimum), and PART methods � and the RORA recession-curve displacement method and associated RECESS program to estimate groundwater recharge from streamflow data.
