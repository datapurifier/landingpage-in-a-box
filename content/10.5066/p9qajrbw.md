# Abstract
This dataset is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) initiative. These data represent the flowline network in the Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA). It is attributed with the number of disconnections (e.g., road crossings) between the reach and Lake Ontario. The more road crossings on a flowline the more disconnected that area is from the lake and the less suitable it will be for restoration. These data help identify the condition of hydrologic separation between potential restoration areas and Lake Ontario. Low numbers represent fewer disconnections, such as culverts, between the reach and the water body requiring no flow network modification to restore the area. Please refer to the process steps and https://glcwra.wim.usgs.gov/ for further explanation on the methods. The GLCWRA initiative identifies coastal wetland areas that have the greatest habitat restoration potential. The data model uses seven parameters to identify and rank wetland restoration areas, resulting in a composite index raster that can be used by ecological managers and planners to assist with the selection of wetland restoration sites. The parameters are Parameter 0: Mask Parameter 1: Hydroperiod Parameter 2: Wetland Soils Parameter 3: Flowlines Parameter 4: Conservation and Recreation Lands Parameter 5: Impervious Surfaces Parameter 6: Land Use (represents developed areas without impervious surfaces but high societal value) The ancillary data include dikes, degree flowlines, study area, and culverts. These data layers are put through an ecological model, which results in a composite restoration index of ranked restoration areas.
