# Abstract
Estimating High Resolution Multi-Cropped Irrigated Land Use Using a Pesticide Use Reporting Database in California Estimating the amount of water needed for agriculture is vital for food and water security. These estimates rely on maps of crop type and acreage that have limited ground-truthing or represent multiple years or regional cropping patterns. In regions where crops change frequently or more than one crop is grown in a season, these data are insufficient for estimating water needs. We developed a method using a pesticide database to estimate crop type and acreage at a 1 square mile resolution for the State of California using a pesticide regulation database. This information can help water managers better plan needs for agriculture in California.
