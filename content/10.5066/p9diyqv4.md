# Abstract
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center conducted research to quantify bathymetric changes surrounding Maui, Hawaii. Changes in seafloor elevation were calculated using historical bathymetric point data from the 1960s (see Yates and others, 2017a) and light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived data acquired in 1999 (NOAA, 2013) using methods outlined in Yate and others (2017b). An elevation change analysis between the 1960s and 1999 data was performed to quantify and map historical impacts to seafloor elevation and to determine elevation-change statistics for 12 habitat types found surrounding Maui. Annual elevation-change rates were calculated for each elevation-change data point. Seafloor elevation-change surrounding Maui was projected 25, 50, 75 and 100 years from 1999 using these historical annual rates of elevation change. Water depth was projected 25, 50, 75 and 100 years from 1999 using historical rates of annual elevation change plus 1999 local sea level rise data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
