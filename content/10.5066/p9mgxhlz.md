# Abstract
This data release includes data and metadata containing estimated and predicted locations of radio telemetered Hawaiian forest birds. Radio telemetry data was collected using an automated radio telemetry network from 2014 to 2019 from birds in two study sites, one a continuous forest and the other a fragmented forest. Four bird species that varied in age and sex were studied: the nectarivorous ?i?iwi (Drepanis coccinea) and ?apapane (Himatione sanguinea), the frugivorous ??ma?o (Myadestes obscurus), and the generalist Hawai?i ?amakihi (Chlorodrepani virens). Data were used in the analysis for the manuscript entitled "Landscape fragmentation alters movement behavior and space use of Hawaiian forest birds."
