# Abstract
Reported here are the fluorescence data points recorded from CRISPR/Cas12a biosensor assays to detect the presence or absence of DNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the causative fungal agent of white-nose syndrome in bats, from artificial controls, dermal swab, and guano samples. Ct values from qPCR experiments are also provided in a table. Furthermore, we also provide the GenBank accession numbers used to develop the aforementioned CRISPR/Cas12a biosensor assay for Pd DNA detection.
