# Abstract
This dataset is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) initiative. These data represent the location of dikes within the Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA) study area. An ArcGIS model (Python script) identified dikes as having a difference in elevation above a certain threshold. If the elevation difference was below a certain threshold, the area was not considered a dike. However, if the difference in elevation between two points was significantly high, then the area was marked as a dike. Areas continuous with each other were considered part of the same dike. Data underwent quality control (QC) procedures by having Subject Matter Experts and those familiar with the area examine the data output, comparing the proposed dike locations to aerial imagery, flowline data, and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Dikes that appeared to be false positives were deleted from the dataset. Please refer to the process steps and https://glcwra.wim.usgs.gov/ for further explanation on the methods. The GLCWRA initiative identifies coastal wetland areas that have the greatest habitat restoration potential. The data model uses seven parameters to identify and rank wetland restoration areas, resulting in a composite index raster that can be used by ecological managers and planners to assist with the selection of wetland restoration sites. The parameters are Parameter 0: Mask Parameter 1: Hydroperiod Parameter 2: Wetland Soils Parameter 3: Flowlines Parameter 4: Conservation and Recreation Lands Parameter 5: Impervious Surfaces Parameter 6: Land Use (represents developed areas without impervious surfaces but high societal value) The ancillary data include dikes, degree flowlines, study area and culverts. These data layers are put through an ecological model, which results in a composite restoration index of ranked restoration areas.
