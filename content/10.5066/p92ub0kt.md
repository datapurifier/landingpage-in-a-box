# Abstract
Software program code for the AFCE (Aqueous Flow Concentration Estimator) that is used to estimate inflow of groundwater contaminants to a water column of an open borehole in a fractured-rock aquifer. It is particularly useful program for assessing ambient flow in low permeability open boreholes, which have no detectable flow as measured with conventional borehole flowmeter tools. The software is in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Excel and utilizes a Monte-Carlo Chemical Budget approach to compute proportional inflow. The program requires coupled data sets quantifying aqueous contaminant concentrations from (1) discrete groundwater samples of fracture zones typically collected with straddle packer deployment, and (2) samples of wellbore water collected from a vertical profile of passive samplers. The discrete samples represent the input at unknown proportions that influence the wellbore water concentration or output. The Monte-Carlo Chemical Budget approach solves for potential proportional inflow combinations through a random generator seed.
