# Abstract
The U.S. Geological Survey conducted experiments during March of 2014 to expand the available data on sand and oil agglomerate motion; test shear stress based incipient motion parameterizations in a controlled, laboratory setting; and directly observe sand and oil agglomerate exhumation and burial processes. Experiments were carried out at the Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, Stennis, Mississippi using a small-oscillatory flow tunnel. HD Video data was collected by two Canon 7D DSLR cameras. 3D flow velocity data was captured by a Vectrino acoustic Doppler current profiler. Additional video data was captured by a GoPro camera placed within the small-oscillatory flow tunnel. For the false-floor incipient motion experiment, movies which combine video data, flow velocity data, calculations of shear stress, and the instant of incipient motion were created. For the movable bed sea-floor interaction experiment, movies which combine video data and flow velocity data were created.
