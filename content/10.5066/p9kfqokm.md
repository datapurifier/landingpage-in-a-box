# Abstract
For the open-file report we collected new coking coal samples from Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arkansas and analyzed them for proximate and ultimate analyses; calorific value; sulfur forms; major-, minor-, and trace-element abundances; free swelling indices; Gieseler plasticity; ASTM dilatation; coal petrography, and several other tests [air-dry loss (ADL), residual moisture (RM), equilibrium moisture (EQM), and true specific gravity (TSG)]. Coal Stability Factor (CSF) and Coal Strength after Reaction with CO2 (CSR) were predicted using chemical, rheological, and petrographic data (pCSF and pCSR, respectively). In addition, data from previously analyzed samples in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Kentucky were shared with us by three companies, including results from the tests listed above, plus oxidation, Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), and ash fusion temperatures. These data are the contents of appendices 2-8 of the open-file report and this data release. In addition, appendices 20 and 21 of the open-file report and this data release include data previously published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) in their Minerals Yearbooks listing the annual amounts of coal purchased (in short tons) for manufacturing oven-coke in six coal districts in Pennsylvania from 1942-1965 (in appendix 20), and the annual amounts of coal received by oven-coke plants (in short tons) in 17 Pennsylvania counties from 1966-1976 (in appendix 21). These previously published data have been included in this data release because they are currently not available online and the original USBM paper publications are not available in most libraries.
