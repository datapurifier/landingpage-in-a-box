# Abstract
Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center in St. Petersburg, Florida (USGS - SPCSMC), conducted a geophysical and imagery survey around Boca Chica Key, Florida, during November 2022. During this study, multibeam bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data were collected aboard the research vessel (R/V) Sallenger using a Reson T50P Dual Head system. Underwater digital images and global positioning system (GPS) data were collected November 7-12, 2022, within a 1.2-kilometer (km) x 0.3-km area around Boca Chica Key, Florida, USA. A total of 23,948 images of the seafloor and water column were collected along track lines oriented parallel to the coast. This data release contains those images (23,948 images), all of which contain GPS data. The data were collected using the USGS polecam, a purpose-built pole-mounted sensor package for mapping shallow-water benthic environments. The polecam uses a Teledyne FLIR Computar V1228-MPY that is connected to a Trimble GPS antenna that accurately records the position of each photograph. Efforts were supported by the Defense Advanced Research Protection Agency (DARPA) Reefense Project and the USGS Coastal Sediment Availability and Flux (CSAF) Project. For further information regarding data collection and/or processing methods refer to the associated metadata.
