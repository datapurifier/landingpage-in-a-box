# Abstract
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled a geodatabase containing mineral-related geospatial data for the People's Republic of China. The data can be used in analyses of the extractive fuel and nonfuel mineral industries and related economic and physical infrastructure integral for the successful operation of the mineral industries within the area of study as well as the movement of mineral products across domestic and global markets. This geodatabase reflects the USGS ongoing commitment to its mission of understanding the nature and distribution of global mineral commodity supply chains by updating and publishing the georeferenced locations of mineral commodity production and processing facilities, mineral exploration and development sites, and mineral commodity exporting ports for the countries in the area of study. The geodatabase contains data feature classes from USGS, foreign governmental, and open-source sources as follows: (1) mineral production and processing facilities, (2) mineral exploration and development sites, (3) mineral occurrence sites and deposits, (4) undiscovered mineral resource tracts for antimony, copper, phosphate, and potash, (5) coal occurrence areas, (6) electric power generating facilities, (7) electric power transmission lines, (8) liquefied natural gas terminals, (9) undiscovered, technically recoverable conventional and continuous hydrocarbon resources (by USGS geologic province), (10) cumulative production and recoverable conventional resources (by province groups), and (11) major mineral exporting maritime ports.
