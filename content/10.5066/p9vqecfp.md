# Abstract
Data tables represents a telemetry study assessing the efficacy of sound and electricity used to herd Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). The study occurred in Jonathan Creek Embayment of Kentucky Lake, Kentucky using 10 telemetered Silver Carp and 46 passive acoustic receivers. Two herding boats traveled at 2.22 meters per second along bank-to-bank transects through the study area (longitudinal progression rate = 0.37 meters per second) emitting sound and electricity (?stimulus?) or no added stimuli (?control?). Fish movement responses included fish presence in the refuge-zones located at either end of the embayment, fish presence fore of herding boats, and fish presence within 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, and 800 meters of the herding boats, and fish velocity.
