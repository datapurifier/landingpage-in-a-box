# Abstract
A validation assessment of Land Cover Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection Collection 1.3 annual land cover products (1985?2021) for the Conterminous United States was conducted with an independently collected reference dataset. Reference data land cover attributes were assigned by trained interpreters for each year of the time series (1984?2021) to a reference sample of 26,971 Landsat resolution (30m x 30m) pixels. These pixels were selected from a sample frame of all pixels in the ARD grid system which fell within the map area (Dwyer et al., 2018). Interpretation used the TimeSync reference data collection tool which visualizes Landsat images and Landsat data values for all usable images in the time series (1984?2021) (Cohen et al., 2010). Interpreters also referred to air photos and high resolution images available in Google Earth as well as several ancillary data layers. The interpreted land cover attributes were crosswalked to the LCMAP annual land cover classes: Developed, Cropland, Grass/Shrub, Tree Cover, Wetland, Water, Snow/Ice and Barren. Validation analysis directly compared reference labels with annual LCMAP land cover map attributes by cross tabulation. The results of that assessment are reported here as confusion matrices for land cover agreement and land cover change agreement. Accuracy and standard errors have been calculated using stratified estimation (Stehman, 2014). Land cover class proportions were also estimated from the reference data for each year, 1985?2021. A cluster sampling formulation was used to calculate standard sampling error for summary tables reporting results for multiple years of data comparison. LCMAP Collection 1.0 annual land cover products covered years 1985?2017 and the validation of the Collection 1.0 products were reported in the�LCMAP Version 1.0 Annual Land Cover and Land Cover Change Validation Tables.�LCMAP Collection 1.1 products covered 1985-2018 and validation was reported in the�LCMAP Collection 1.1 Annual Land Cover and Land Cover Change Validation Tables.��LCMAP Collection 1.2 products covered 1985-2020 and validation was reported in the LCMAP Collection 1.2 Annual Land Cover and Land Cover Change Validation Tables.
