# Abstract
This product consists of multiple tabular datasets and associated metadata of water quality information related to rivers, streams, and lakes in the Yukon River watershed between 2014 and 2018. This data release is apart of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funded Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) and is an assessment of water quality and greenhouse gas fluxes within the interior of Alaska. Sampling frequency varied across locations, with some sites sampled twice a year or more. Data consist of: organic and inorganic carbon related species, carbon dioxide and methane gas fluxes calculated from manual chamber measurements, nitrogen species, carbon isotopes, oxygen and deuterium isotopes, cations, anions, trace metals, and various in situ measurements including: pH, water temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, secchi depth, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and specific conductance.
