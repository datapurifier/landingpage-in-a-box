# Abstract
This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data release contains results from the 2019 geomorphic survey of North Fork Eagle Creek, New Mexico. The 2019 geomorphic survey was conducted by the USGS, in cooperation with the Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, and is the third in a planned series of five annual geomorphic surveys of the stream reach located between the North Fork Eagle Creek near Alto, New Mexico, streamflow-gaging station (USGS site 08387550) and the Eagle Creek below South Fork near Alto, New Mexico, streamflow-gaging station (USGS site 08387600). Specifically, this data release includes the results from 14 cross-section surveys (including locations and elevations of all cross-section points), the locations of all woody debris accumulations identified in the reach (and their respective debris jam classifications), the locations of all pools identified in the reach (and their respective residual depths), and the locations of other features of geomorphic significance in the reach. Location and elevation data were primarily collected by using survey-grade real-time kinematic global navigation satellite systems (RTK GNSS) but the locations of some features were determined or estimated by using field notes, photographs, and digital mapping software. This data release supports the following publication: Graziano, A.P., and Chavarria, S.B. 2022, Geomorphic survey of North Fork Eagle Creek, New Mexico, 2019: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report.
