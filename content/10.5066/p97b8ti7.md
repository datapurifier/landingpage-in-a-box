# Abstract
Data set is a combined collection of post-fire species point intercept cover monitoring data across the Murphy 2007 fire, Rush 2012 fire, Holloway 2012 fire, and Soda 2015 fire. Data was collected between 2008 and 2022 by the Bureau of Land Management, US Geological Survey, and Idaho Fish and Wildfire for various purposes. The species data was leveraged to assess post-fire community structure and trajectories.
