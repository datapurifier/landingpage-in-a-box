# Abstract
The Great Lakes Research Vessel Catch (RVCAT) database is managed at the Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC). RVCAT has been used as the primary data collection tool aboard the GLSC?s research vessel operations across the Great Lakes. Content: The data set has been collected on various vessel operations on all the Great Lakes and select connecting waterways between the years 1930-2021. Data collection begins in early spring and ends in late fall. Each vessel operation was completed for a specific purpose, or target mission. Data Structure: These data are collected at the GLSC in the RVCAT Oracle database. This database has been broken down into comma separated value (csv) spreadsheets in order to facilitate greater accessibility. These csv spreadsheets are grouped by the sample type (such as Trawl, Gillnet, Mensuration, etc.). The database structure is described within the metadata record (XML), a sample type specific data dictionary, and entity relationship diagram within each sample type's landing page. Data Release Method: An updated version of the data will be published at least yearly, which could include new surveys and/ or updated data. The metadata will also be updated alongside these data releases. Data Quality: Note that the following data release is a snapshot of the database at the time of release. Some data quality checks are still being undertaken after the time of release. Also, a large section of this database includes legacy data that, if issues arise for cannot always be addressed definitively, but nevertheless adds great value to the database. When approaching the following data release, it is suggested to approach the Great Lakes Science Center's researchers for input.
