# Abstract
A continuous ice core analytical system was used to analyze the ~410 m NEEM-2011-S1 ice core collected in summer 2011 near the NEEM deep drilling site in NW Greenland. The core was analyzed for a broad range of elements and chemical species using a coupled continuous flow analysis system with two inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers and single-particle soot photometer. The aerosol records are provided at 2 cm depth resolution to account for signal dispersion in the online analytical system. All records are on the NS1-2011 ice-core chronology: Between 1258 and 1997 CE, this chronology is based on mannual annual-layer counting based on multi-parameter aerosol records constrained by historic volcanic age markers (i.e. Krakatao 1883; Tambora 1815; Laki 1783; Mount Parker 1641; Huaynaputina 1600; Veidiv√∂tn 1477; Samalas 1257). Between 86 CE and 1258 CE, this chronology is based on automated annual-layer counting using the StratiCounter program, an automated, objective, annual-layer detection method based on Hidden Markov Model algorithms based on multi-parameter aerosol records and constrained by a solar proton events in 775 and 993 CE, and documentary evidence of volcanic dust veils in 536, 626 and 939 CE.
