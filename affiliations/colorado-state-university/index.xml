      <description>Abstract This dataset presents comprehensive information on the development and characterization of antibacterial polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings incorporating tanfloc, a plant-derived condensed tannin polymer with inherent antimicrobial properties. The dataset encompasses experimental data related to the fabrication of PEMs using tanfloc as either a polyanion or a polycation, expanding the versatility of this amphoteric polymer in PEM coatings. Typically, PEMs are formed by combining a polycation and a polyanion with complementary ionic groups.</description>

      <description>Abstract Plant populations are limited by resource availability and exhibit physiological trade-offs in resource acquisition strategies. These trade-offs may constrain the ability of populations to exhibit fast growth rates under water limitation and high cover of neighbors. However, traits that confer drought tolerance may also confer resistance to competition. It remains unclear how fitness responses to these abiotic conditions and biotic interactions combine to structure grassland communities and how this relationship may change along a gradient of water availability.</description>

      <title>Observation of mHz-level cooperative Lamb shifts in an optical atomic clock</title>

      <description>Abstract We report on the direct observation of resonant electric dipole-dipole interactions in a cubic array of atoms in the many-excitation limit. The interactions, mediated by single-atom couplings to the shared electromagnetic vacuum, are shown to produce spatially-dependent cooperative Lamb shifts when spectroscopically interrogating the mHz-wide optical clock transition in strontium-87. We show that the ensemble-averaged shifts can be suppressed below the level of evaluated systematic uncertainties for state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks.</description>

      <description>Abstract This respository contains multiple datasets collected during a 20 year investigation of the responses of willow (Salix spp.) communities in Yellowstone National Park after the restoration of large carnivores. The study sought to understand whether the restoration of wolves to the food web cause a change in the state of willow communities that occured while wolves were absent. Each dataset has a corresonding file of metadata.
Methods Sampling and experimental designs and methods used to collect the data were described in Hobbs, N.</description>
