      <description>Abstract We investigate the possibility to use polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in stalagmites as proxies for paleofires at KNI-51, a shallow cave located in tropical Western Australia, where bushfire is a regular occurrence. In order to test links between the stalagmite PAHs and fire above the cave, we performed a series of experiments using PAH distributions in stalagmite aragonite, sediment from the cave and overlying soil. In addition, the possibility of surface contamination was evaluated by measuring PAH abundances and distributions in sequential digestions.</description>
