      <description>Abstract Introduced (non-native) species that become established may eventually become invasive, so tracking all introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally. The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) (ver. 2.0, November 2022, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9KFFTOD), as of 2022-10-23, is comprised of three lists, for the localities of Alaska (AK, with 545 records), Hawaii (HI, with 5,628 records), and the conterminous (or lower 48) United States (L48, with 8,527 records).</description>

      <title>Occurrences of Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) sequences in public accessions of Apis mellifera and Varroa destructor</title>

      <description>Abstract Honey bees (Apis mellifera), a critical agricultural pollinator in many areas, have a high rate of infection with a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV), yet little is known about its ecology or impact on honey bee colonies, other than its ubiquity and apparent low virulence. This study scanned over 5,000 public data sets to detect AmFV sequences in honey bees as well as a parasitic mite of honey bees, Varroa destructor, that is a potential vector of AmFV.</description>

      <title>Brook trout abundance in streams across southern Appalachia from 1958-2021</title>

      <description>Abstract This Data Release compiles records of brook trout abundance from 745 unique sites across the southern Appalachian mountains from 1958-2021. Records were compiled from 10 institutions, primarily state natural resource agencies. Data were collected from wadeable stream environments with standard backpack electrofishing methods, and observed abundances of adult and juvenile brook trout are reported for each electrofishing pass within sample sites.

      <description>Abstract This data release includes data and metadata containing estimated and predicted locations of radio telemetered Hawaiian forest birds. Radio telemetry data was collected using an automated radio telemetry network from 2014 to 2019 from birds in two study sites, one a continuous forest and the other a fragmented forest. Four bird species that varied in age and sex were studied: the nectarivorous ?i?iwi (Drepanis coccinea) and ?apapane (Himatione sanguinea), the frugivorous ?</description>

      <title>North American Bird Banding Program Dataset 1960-2023 retrieved 2023-07-12</title>

      <description>Abstract The North American Bird Banding Program is administered through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL), Eastern Ecological Science Center at the Patuxent Research Refuge (EESC) and the Bird Banding Office (BBO), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The respective banding offices have similar functions and policies and use the same bands, reporting forms and data formats. This long-term dataset (1960-2023) consists of over 83 million bird banding, encounter and recapture records of over 1,000 species covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA).</description>

      <description>Abstract Introduced (non-native) species that becomes established may eventually become invasive, so tracking introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally. The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) is comprised of three lists, one each for Alaska (AK, with 532 records), Hawaii (HI, with 6,075 records), and the conterminous United States (L48, with 8,657 records). Each list includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality.</description>

      <description>Abstract This stable isotope dataset includes the carbon and nitrogen values for loggerhead, Kemp&amp;rsquo;s ridley, green sea turtles and their prey items in St. Joseph Bay, FL sampled between 2011 and 2021. 2. This dataset was created from a collection of sea turtle diet papers to produce a comprehensive summary of sea turtle diet based on scientific publications for loggerhead, Kemp&amp;rsquo;s ridley and green turtles.

      <title>Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data obtained for 34 long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus) individuals at 91 loci</title>
      <link>http://example.org/10.5066/p9yd9m3p/</link>

      <description>Abstract Prior to removal of pest species from an area, resource managers must determine if re-immigration from another population is possible. Voles inhabiting Saddle Rock on the southern Oregon coast are suspected to be partially responsible for declines in the Leach&amp;rsquo;s storm petrel colony on the island. The island is very close to the mainland, and it is potentially accessible during below-average low tides. USGS scientists Mark Miller and Susan Haig and colleagues used genetic techniques to assess island vole population connectivity.</description>
