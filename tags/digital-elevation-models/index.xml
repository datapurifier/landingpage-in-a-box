      <description>Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center conducted research to quantify bathymetric changes near Buck Island and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Changes in seafloor elevation were calculated using historical bathymetric point data from the 1980s (see Yates and others, 2017a) and light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived data acquired in 2014 (NOAA, 2015) using methods outlined in Yates and others (2017b). An elevation change analysis between the 1980s and 2014 data was performed to quantify and map historical impacts to seafloor elevation and to determine elevation-change statistics for 12 habitat types found near St, Croix.</description>

Changes in seafloor elevation were calculated using historical bathymetric point data from the 1960s and 1970s (see Yates and others, 2017a) and light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived elevation data acquired in 2014 (NOAA, 2015) using methods outlined in Yates and others (2017b).
