      <description>Abstract This respository contains multiple datasets collected during a 20 year investigation of the responses of willow (Salix spp.) communities in Yellowstone National Park after the restoration of large carnivores. The study sought to understand whether the restoration of wolves to the food web cause a change in the state of willow communities that occured while wolves were absent. Each dataset has a corresonding file of metadata.
Methods Sampling and experimental designs and methods used to collect the data were described in Hobbs, N.</description>
