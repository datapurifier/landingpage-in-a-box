      <description>Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled a geodatabase containing mineral-related geospatial data for the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. The data can be used in analyses of the extractive fuel and nonfuel mineral industries and related economic and physical infrastructure integral for the successful operation of the mineral industries within the area of study as well as the movement of mineral products across domestic and global markets. This geodatabase reflects the USGS ongoing commitment to its mission of understanding the nature and distribution of global mineral commodity supply chains by updating and publishing the georeferenced locations of mineral commodity production and processing facilities, mineral exploration and development sites, and mineral commodity exporting ports for the countries in the area of study.</description>

      <description>Abstract Mineral abundances within bulk and size-fractionated mine waste from sampled historical waste piles from the Tar Creek Superfund Site, Oklahoma, U.S.A., were determined by Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Data and methods reported are part of a research study published below in the &amp;lsquo;Related External Resources&amp;rsquo; section.
