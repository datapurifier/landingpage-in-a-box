      <description>Abstract This data release contains land cover-derived statistics regarding estuarine vegetated wetland area change within estuary drainage areas along the conterminous U.S. This dataset includes net change in estuarine vegetated wetland area based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&amp;rsquo;s (NOAA) Coastal Change Assessment Program (C-CAP) 1996 and 2016 land cover data. Net change was assessed between estuarine vegetated wetlands (i.e., estuarine marshes, mangroves, non-mangrove estuarine woody wetlands, and salt pannes, depending on vegetation coverage and type) and the following other landcover classes: 1) water; 2) unconsolidated shore; 3) freshwater woody wetlands; 4) freshwater marsh; 5) upland; and 6) agriculture.</description>

      <title>Post-fire species point intercept data from four megafires in the Great Basin</title>

      <description>Abstract Data set is a combined collection of post-fire species point intercept cover monitoring data across the Murphy 2007 fire, Rush 2012 fire, Holloway 2012 fire, and Soda 2015 fire. Data was collected between 2008 and 2022 by the Bureau of Land Management, US Geological Survey, and Idaho Fish and Wildfire for various purposes. The species data was leveraged to assess post-fire community structure and trajectories.

      <title>Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) Green Bay, U.S.: Dikes</title>

      <description>Abstract This dataset is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) initiative. These data represent the location of dikes within the Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA) study area. An ArcGIS model (Python script) identified dikes as having a difference in elevation above a certain threshold. If the elevation difference was below a certain threshold, the area was not considered a dike. However, if the difference in elevation between two points was significantly high, then the area was marked as a dike.</description>

      <description>Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation?s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation?</description>

      <title>Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Collection 1.3 Annual Land Cover and Land Cover Change Validation Tables (1985&amp;amp;amp;ndash;2021) for the Conterminous United States</title>

      <description>Abstract A validation assessment of Land Cover Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection Collection 1.3 annual land cover products (1985?2021) for the Conterminous United States was conducted with an independently collected reference dataset. Reference data land cover attributes were assigned by trained interpreters for each year of the time series (1984?2021) to a reference sample of 26,971 Landsat resolution (30m x 30m) pixels. These pixels were selected from a sample frame of all pixels in the ARD grid system which fell within the map area (Dwyer et al.</description>
