      <description>Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) compiled and analyzed data for mapping groundwater salinity, characterizing aquifer systems, and documenting the effects of oil field water injection in the Elk Hills Elk Hills, Buena Vista, and Coles Levee Oil Fields, San Joaquin Valley, California. Data provided in this data release include borehole geophysical data, geochemical analyses of water samples, hydrologic data, geological formation depths, and information on observed well log resistivity anomalies - interpreted to be from injection for disposal of produced water from oil wells or from natural causes.</description>

      <description>Abstract Temporal and spatial sources of silica for chert remain poorly constrained. Modern sources to the worlds oceans include silica in rivers &amp;gt; aeolian (dust) deposition &amp;gt; sea floor vents and submarine weathering. However, changes in aridity and dust flux during the Phanerozoic may explain variations in the ocean silica cycle and times and places of chert formation. The chemistry of fine quartz dust (FQD) provides a chemical mechanism for the transformation of FQD to polymorphs of silica in chert; FQD is readily dissolved, then reprecipitated as Opal-A by either biotic or abiotic processes.</description>

      <description>Abstract Low biomass waters provide a unique challenge in the field of microbial ecology. It is difficult to determine, when biomass concentrations are extremely low, whether or not the sequencing data received are of good quality and representative of the waters sampled. Fifty-nine samples including 8 blanks were collected from a low biomass hydraulically fractured well producing from the Niobrara Shale in Colorado. At least 4 samples were collected by filtering the exact volume for each listed here: 1000 mL, 900 mL, 800 mL, 700 mL, 600 mL, 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL, 200 mL, 100 mL, 0 mL (blanks).</description>

      <description>Abstract For the open-file report we collected new coking coal samples from Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arkansas and analyzed them for proximate and ultimate analyses; calorific value; sulfur forms; major-, minor-, and trace-element abundances; free swelling indices; Gieseler plasticity; ASTM dilatation; coal petrography, and several other tests [air-dry loss (ADL), residual moisture (RM), equilibrium moisture (EQM), and true specific gravity (TSG)]. Coal Stability Factor (CSF) and Coal Strength after Reaction with CO2 (CSR) were predicted using chemical, rheological, and petrographic data (pCSF and pCSR, respectively).</description>

      <description>Abstract The United States Gulf Coast Basin Curated Wells and Logs Database (CWLDB) is an online repository with stratigraphic information for petroleum wells in the United States portion of the onshore Gulf of Mexico Basin that provides several of the following attributes: a) deep penetrations (generally, total depth of 10,000 feet or more), b) high quality and diverse geophysical well log suites, c) lithostratigraphic logs, d) biostratigraphic units (biozones) and reports, and/or e) core or cuttings samples.</description>

      <description>Abstract The dataset covers Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) measurements taken from altered kerogen in shales from the Woodford formation. The ATR measurements were taken after the samples were run through supercritical CO2 alteration experiments in a brine solution.
