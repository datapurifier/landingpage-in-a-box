      <description>Abstract This data release contains processed high-resolution multichannel sparker seismic-reflection (MCS) data that were collected aboard Humboldt State University&amp;rsquo;s R/V Coral Sea in October of 2018 on U.S. Geological Survey cruise 2018-658-FA on the shelf and slope between Cape Blanco, Oregon, and Cape Mendocino, California. MCS data were collected to characterize quaternary deformation and sediment dynamics along the southern Cascadia margin.

      <title>REDPy - Repeating Earthquake Detector in Python (Version 1.0.1)</title>

      <description>Abstract REDPy (Repeating Earthquake Detector in Python) is a tool for automated detection and analysis of repeating earthquakes in continuous data. It works without any previous assumptions of what repeating seismicity looks like (that is, does not require a template event). Repeating earthquakes are clustered into families based on waveform similarity via cross-correlation across multiple stations. All data, including waveforms, are stored in a HDF5 database using PyTables.

      <description>Abstract The Atlas of ShakeMaps (~14,100 earthquakes, 1900-2020) provides a consistent and quantitative description of the distribution of shaking intensity for calibrating earthquake loss estimation methodologies, like those used in the USGS Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER)�system. Version 4 of the Atlas includes a vastly expanded compilation of ShakeMaps for consequential and widely felt earthquakes using updated ShakeMap (Version 4)�software. For each event, we have attempted to gather available macroseismic, recorded ground motions and finite fault inputs.</description>
