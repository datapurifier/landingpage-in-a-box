      <description>Abstract This data release contains land cover-derived statistics regarding estuarine vegetated wetland area change within estuary drainage areas along the conterminous U.S. This dataset includes net change in estuarine vegetated wetland area based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&amp;rsquo;s (NOAA) Coastal Change Assessment Program (C-CAP) 1996 and 2016 land cover data. Net change was assessed between estuarine vegetated wetlands (i.e., estuarine marshes, mangroves, non-mangrove estuarine woody wetlands, and salt pannes, depending on vegetation coverage and type) and the following other landcover classes: 1) water; 2) unconsolidated shore; 3) freshwater woody wetlands; 4) freshwater marsh; 5) upland; and 6) agriculture.</description>

      <description>Abstract This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data release contains the results from the 2017 geomorphic survey of North Fork Eagle Creek, New Mexico. The 2017 geomorphic survey was conducted by the USGS, in cooperation with the Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, and is the first in a planned series of five annual geomorphic surveys of the stream reach located between the North Fork Eagle Creek near Alto, New Mexico, streamflow-gaging station (USGS site 08387550) and the Eagle Creek below South Fork near Alto, New Mexico, streamflow-gaging station (USGS site 08387600).</description>

      <description>Abstract This data release includes data created, collected, and/or otherwise modified in the process of quantifying a sediment budget for the Smith Creek Watershed near New Market, Virginia, USA. Five raster files are included, namely a modeled index of hydrological connectivity, a raster model of modeled floodplain depositional masses and extent, a rasters of modeled gross and delivered upland erosion, and a hydrologically conditioned Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Two vector shapefiles are also included.</description>

      <description>Abstract The following report summarizes the dating results from the San Luis Valley-Pioneer Fan 2017-2019 dating project. Within this report, we detail the methodology used by the USGS Luminescence Geochronology Laboratory to obtain ages including sample preparation methods, luminescence measurement, equivalent dose determination, and dating-related calculations. We recommend that this report be included as the supplementary material for any publication(s) that use the ages within this report.

      <description>Abstract This data release includes the data and code used for the manuscript titled &amp;ldquo;A framework to facilitate development and testing of image-based river velocimetry algorithms&amp;rdquo;, submitted to the journal Earth Surface Processes and Landforms. Three *.csv files and five *.m files with MATLAB source code are included below. Each *.csv file contains output from a hydrodynamic model of a reach of the Sacramento River near Glenn, California, with a separate file for each of three different discharges (i.</description>
