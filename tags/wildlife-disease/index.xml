      <description>Abstract Introduced (non-native) species that become established may eventually become invasive, so tracking all introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally. The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) (ver. 2.0, November 2022, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9KFFTOD), as of 2022-10-23, is comprised of three lists, for the localities of Alaska (AK, with 545 records), Hawaii (HI, with 5,628 records), and the conterminous (or lower 48) United States (L48, with 8,527 records).</description>

      <title>Occurrences of Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) sequences in public accessions of Apis mellifera and Varroa destructor</title>

      <description>Abstract Honey bees (Apis mellifera), a critical agricultural pollinator in many areas, have a high rate of infection with a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV), yet little is known about its ecology or impact on honey bee colonies, other than its ubiquity and apparent low virulence. This study scanned over 5,000 public data sets to detect AmFV sequences in honey bees as well as a parasitic mite of honey bees, Varroa destructor, that is a potential vector of AmFV.</description>

      <description>Abstract The data presented here are blacklegged tick nymph densities, white-tailed deer densities, and Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) prevalences for eight national parks in the eastern United States from 2014-2022.

      <title>Data from the development and evaluation of a CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensor for the detection of DNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans using samples collected from various species of bats across the United States, from 2018 to 2023</title>

      <description>Abstract Reported here are the fluorescence data points recorded from CRISPR/Cas12a biosensor assays to detect the presence or absence of DNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the causative fungal agent of white-nose syndrome in bats, from artificial controls, dermal swab, and guano samples. Ct values from qPCR experiments are also provided in a table. Furthermore, we also provide the GenBank accession numbers used to develop the aforementioned CRISPR/Cas12a biosensor assay for Pd DNA detection.</description>

      <description>Abstract Introduced (non-native) species that becomes established may eventually become invasive, so tracking introduced species provides a baseline for effective modeling of species trends and interactions, geospatially and temporally. The United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS) is comprised of three lists, one each for Alaska (AK, with 532 records), Hawaii (HI, with 6,075 records), and the conterminous United States (L48, with 8,657 records). Each list includes introduced (non-native), established (reproducing) taxa that: are, or may become, invasive (harmful) in the locality; are not known to be harmful there; and/or have been used for biological control in the locality.</description>

      <description>Abstract We conducted a serosurvey of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) for vector-borne pathogens in 2016-2017 that were captured in the Hiawatha National Forest in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. At capture, in addition to age, sex, body weight of the hare and a blood sample data was collected on the ecological land type (USDA Forest Service. 2006. Hiawatha National Forest 2006 Forest Plan. https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/hiawatha/landmanagement/planning/?cid=STELPRDB5106336) at the point of capture.</description>
