      <description>Abstract Manufacturing continues to be a vital component of the Ohio economy. Ohio&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing sector employs over 600,000 skilled individuals, the third-largest manufacturing workforce in the U.S. [1]. With additional manufacturing industries moving into Ohio, including Intel and its supply chain partners, there is a growing need for industry-ready, skilled engineering technicians. In addition, with the increasing use of automated systems and network connectivity of these systems in manufacturing operations, technicians need to be equipped with skills in the area of smart manufacturing.</description>

      <description>Abstract The paper introduces ECO-CHIP, a framework for measuring the carbon footprint (CFP) of a heterogeneous system across its lifespan. This artifact is released on Zenodo and contains two parts. The first is ECO-CHIP submodule from GitHub, and the second is a folder that consists of the experiments performed in this paper using ECO-CHIP. The minimal hardware requirements are any single-core CPU, and the software requirements are Python 3.9 with pip 22.</description>

      <description>Abstract Color reflectance data were measured on section halves using an integration sphere and a UV-VIS spectrophotometer mounted on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Spectral counts are recorded in the range of 380 to 700 nm, covering the visible spectrum, and binned in ~2 nm bins. Spectral data are reduced from spectra and recorded in tristimulus XYZ values, CieLAB Lab* values, and other units.

Because all JRSO cores meet minimum size requirements for these two probes, MSPOINT data are corrected for volume and recorded in SI susceptibility units (x10-5).

      <description>Abstract Magnetic susceptibility was measured on whole-round sections (and rarely section halves) on the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) and/or Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) using a Bartington MS2 meter and a 90 mm or 80 mm MS2C loop. As volume of the sample is not controlled for this experiment, susceptibility units are recorded in instrument units and are not volume-corrected.

      <description>Abstract Moisture and density (MAD) data were acquired on ~10 mL sediment or rock samples by measuring three out of four material parameters: wet (saturated) mass, wet volume, dry mass, and/or dry volume after 24 h drying in a convection oven at 105 degrees C. From the moisture and volume measurements, the following phase relationships are calculated: wet and dry water content, wet bulk density, dry bulk density, grain density, porosity, and void ratio.</description>

      <description>Abstract Natural gamma radiation (NGR) data in the ~0.1 to 3.0 MeV range were measured using eight custom-designed sodium iodide (thallium) [NaI(Tl)] detectors arranged along the core measurement axis at 20 cm intervals. The NGR system uses layers of passive shielding (lead) and active shielding (plastic scintillators and coincidence electronics) to reduce the cosmic-ray signal for low-count analysis of sediment core sections and to obtain the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Data are reported on a total counts per second basis and the raw spectral files are available as compressed files for later analysis.</description>

Cores were imaged as soon as possible after splitting to minimize color changes that occur through oxidation and drying. The SHIL produces TIF files as well as reduced-size JPG files. The TIF files are not kept online but users may request them from the IODP-JRSO Data Librarian.</description>

      <description>Abstract Hard rock and sediment thin section images were acquired using either the JRSO-developed Petrographic Image Capture and Archival Tool (PICAT) imager or (rarely) an upright microscope and a digital camera. Sample images are acquired in unpolarized, polarized, and/or cross-polarized light. Image files are presented compressed by hole.

      <description>Abstract Images of the outside of hard rock whole-round sections were acquired using a linescan imager (Section Half Imaging Logger [SHIL]) and a special holder that allows each 90 degree segment of the outer surface to be positioned properly. The images were taken at a resolution of 20 lines/mm (50 micropixels). JRSO staff take these quadrant images and compile them into a side-by-side rollout photograph of the section. Composite images are available as both JPG and TIF image formats.</description>

      <description>Abstract This dataset contains data from 645,337 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped on GenoChip 2+ microarrays. The SNP data were ascertained from the mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomes for each individual, depending on their biological sex. In total, 5,205 mtDNA and 10,272 Y-chromosome SNPs were extracted from the array data. These data files have been uploaded as .csv files and also be uploaded as plink-formatted files. Details about the analysis of the SNP data can be found in the associated manuscript: Theodore G Schurr, Ramaz Shengelia, Michel Shamoon-Pour, David Chitanava, Shorena Laliashvili, Irma Laliashvili, Redate Kibret, Yanu Kume-Kangkolo, Irakli Akhvlediani, Lia Bitadze, Iain Mathieson, Aram Yardumian, Genetic Analysis of Mingrelians Reveals Long-Term Continuity of Populations in Western Georgia (Caucasus), Genome Biology and Evolution, 2023; evad198, https://doi.</description>
