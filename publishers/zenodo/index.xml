      <description>Abstract Manufacturing continues to be a vital component of the Ohio economy. Ohio&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing sector employs over 600,000 skilled individuals, the third-largest manufacturing workforce in the U.S. [1]. With additional manufacturing industries moving into Ohio, including Intel and its supply chain partners, there is a growing need for industry-ready, skilled engineering technicians. In addition, with the increasing use of automated systems and network connectivity of these systems in manufacturing operations, technicians need to be equipped with skills in the area of smart manufacturing.</description>

      <description>Abstract The paper introduces ECO-CHIP, a framework for measuring the carbon footprint (CFP) of a heterogeneous system across its lifespan. This artifact is released on Zenodo and contains two parts. The first is ECO-CHIP submodule from GitHub, and the second is a folder that consists of the experiments performed in this paper using ECO-CHIP. The minimal hardware requirements are any single-core CPU, and the software requirements are Python 3.9 with pip 22.</description>

      <description>Abstract This database contains the single KMC-step datasets for the &amp;ldquo;Ordered&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Random&amp;rdquo; rate lattice gas systems, as well the &amp;ldquo;Complex&amp;rdquo; high-entropy alloy to accompany our main publication along with our code repository mentioned therein. The datasets are given as HDF5 files, readable with the h5py module in python 3. These files are listed below:
CrystalData: CrystData.h5 and CrystData_ortho_5_cube.h5 contain all the necessary FCC crystal structure data for primitive 8x8x8 and orthogonal 5x5x5 FCC supercells.</description>

      <description>Abstract This dataset contains data from 645,337 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped on GenoChip 2+ microarrays. The SNP data were ascertained from the mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomes for each individual, depending on their biological sex. In total, 5,205 mtDNA and 10,272 Y-chromosome SNPs were extracted from the array data. These data files have been uploaded as .csv files and also be uploaded as plink-formatted files. Details about the analysis of the SNP data can be found in the associated manuscript: Theodore G Schurr, Ramaz Shengelia, Michel Shamoon-Pour, David Chitanava, Shorena Laliashvili, Irma Laliashvili, Redate Kibret, Yanu Kume-Kangkolo, Irakli Akhvlediani, Lia Bitadze, Iain Mathieson, Aram Yardumian, Genetic Analysis of Mingrelians Reveals Long-Term Continuity of Populations in Western Georgia (Caucasus), Genome Biology and Evolution, 2023; evad198, https://doi.</description>
