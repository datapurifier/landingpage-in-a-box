      <description>Abstract This dataset is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) initiative. These data represent the location of dikes within the Green Bay Restoration Assessment (GBRA) study area. An ArcGIS model (Python script) identified dikes as having a difference in elevation above a certain threshold. If the elevation difference was below a certain threshold, the area was not considered a dike. However, if the difference in elevation between two points was significantly high, then the area was marked as a dike.</description>
