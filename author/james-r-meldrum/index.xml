      <description>Abstract Household survey data about participation in wildfire risk mitigation cost-share programs and related questions, including stated barriers to conducting wildfire risk mitigation, basic demographics, and willingness to pay toward that cost-share program. Data (n=1,689) were collected in 95 communities exposed to wildfire risk in six counties in western Colorado, 2013-2017, with an overall survey response rate of 41.9%. The household surveys providing data were organized and implemented by two regional wildfire risk mitigation organizations, West Region Wildfire Council and Wildfire Adapted Partnership (formerly Firewise of Southwest Colorado).</description>
