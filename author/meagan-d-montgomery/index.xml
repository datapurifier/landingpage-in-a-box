      <description>Abstract This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Data Release provides water-quality data collected during 1-week and 2-week nutrient studies beginning on February 22, May 17, and July 26 located in the Caloosahatchee River at the S-79 water-control structure. For each study period, 12 fiberglass tanks were suspended in the river using three floating cradles with each cradle holding four tanks. Each tank was open to the atmosphere and closed to the river.</description>
