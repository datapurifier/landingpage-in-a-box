      <description>Abstract The paper introduces ECO-CHIP, a framework for measuring the carbon footprint (CFP) of a heterogeneous system across its lifespan. This artifact is released on Zenodo and contains two parts. The first is ECO-CHIP submodule from GitHub, and the second is a folder that consists of the experiments performed in this paper using ECO-CHIP. The minimal hardware requirements are any single-core CPU, and the software requirements are Python 3.9 with pip 22.</description>
